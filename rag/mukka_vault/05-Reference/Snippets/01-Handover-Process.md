# Handover Process

## Content
```
For handover prompts, I suggest a couple of options:

1. **Simple trigger**: 
   - "Create handover" or "Update handover"
   - "Save project state"

2. **More descriptive**:
   - "Save project state for continuation"
   - "Create handover document for next session"

Whenever you use one of these prompts, I'll:
1. Update the current-handover.md file
2. Create a dated copy in the Handovers directory
3. Summarize where we are and what's next

When you start a new chat, you can say "Let's continue our work on the MCP project" and reference the latest handover document. I'll be able to quickly understand where we left off and continue seamlessly.
```

## Context
This snippet was created during the initial MCP project setup to establish a protocol for maintaining continuity between chat sessions. It addresses the issue of context loss when reaching Claude's response limits.

## Usage
Use the suggested trigger phrases at the end of a productive session to save the current state. When starting a new session, reference the latest handover document to quickly restore context.
