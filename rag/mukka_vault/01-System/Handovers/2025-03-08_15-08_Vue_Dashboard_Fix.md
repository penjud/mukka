# Vue Dashboard Fix - Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the fix implemented for the Vue Dashboard container that was not automatically starting after system restarts and had port configuration issues.

## Problem
1. The Vue Dashboard container wasn't starting automatically when other containers restarted.
2. There was a port configuration mismatch between the Dockerfile (which was using port 3002) and the nginx configuration (which was listening on port 80).
3. The Docker Compose configuration had the vue-dashboard service, but it wasn't being recognized by the current Docker Compose context.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Port Configuration Fix
- Modified the Vue Dashboard `nginx.conf` to listen on port 80 instead of port 3002
- Updated the Dockerfile to expose port 80 instead of port 3002
- Ensured proper port mapping in the container (host 3002 → container 80)

### 2. Automatic Startup Configuration
- Created a desktop autostart entry at `/home/mothership/.config/autostart/mukka-vue-dashboard.desktop`
- Enhanced the startup script to wait for Docker Desktop to be fully running
- This ensures the Vue Dashboard container starts automatically after login

### 3. Documentation Updates
- Created documentation in the code repository explaining the configuration
- Added comments to the Docker-related files for better understanding
- Created this handover document to explain the changes made

## Testing Done
1. **Container Operation Verification**
   - Successfully stopped and removed the old container
   - Successfully created and started the new container
   - Verified container logs show proper startup without errors
   
2. **Port Configuration Verification**
   - Verified nginx is listening on port 80 inside the container
   - Verified port 3002 on the host is properly mapped to port 80 in the container
   - Tested HTTP access to http://localhost:3002 and confirmed it works

## How to Use

### Automatic Startup
The Vue Dashboard is configured to start automatically when you log in to your desktop environment:

1. A desktop autostart entry has been created at:
   ```
   /home/mothership/.config/autostart/mukka-vue-dashboard.desktop
   ```

2. This entry runs the startup script which:
   - Waits for Docker Desktop to be fully running
   - Stops and removes any existing Vue Dashboard container
   - Creates a new container with the correct configuration

3. The Vue Dashboard should be accessible at http://localhost:3002 a few minutes after login

### Manual Startup
If you need to manually start or restart the Vue Dashboard:

```bash
cd /home/mothership/mukka
./start-vue-dashboard.sh
```

The script will:
- Stop and remove any existing Vue Dashboard container
- Create a new container with the correct configuration
- Provide feedback on the success or failure of the operation

## Technical Details

### Container Configuration
- Image: `mukka_vue-dashboard`
- Container Name: `mukka-vue-dashboard`
- Network: `mukka_mukka-network`
- Port Mapping: Host 3002 → Container 80
- Environment Variables:
  - MCP_BASE_URL=http://mukka-mcp-base-server:8090
  - MCP_MEMORY_URL=http://mukka-mcp-memory-server:8094
  - MCP_FILESYSTEM_URL=http://mukka-mcp-filesystem-server:8095
  - MCP_BRAVE_SEARCH_URL=http://mukka-mcp-brave-search-server:8096
  - MCP_OLLAMA_URL=http://mukka-mcp-ollama-bridge:8082
  - MCP_AUTH_URL=http://mukka-mcp-auth-server:8097

### Important Files
- `/home/mothership/.config/autostart/mukka-vue-dashboard.desktop` - Desktop autostart entry
- `/home/mothership/mukka/start-vue-dashboard.sh` - Script to start the container
- `/home/mothership/mukka/frontend/vue-dashboard/nginx.conf` - nginx configuration file
- `/home/mothership/mukka/frontend/vue-dashboard/Dockerfile` - Container build definition
- `/home/mothership/mukka/VUE-DASHBOARD-README.md` - Detailed documentation

## Potential Future Improvements
1. Investigate why Docker Compose doesn't recognize the vue-dashboard service
2. Consider creating a systemd service that properly waits for Docker Desktop
3. Add health checks to verify the Vue Dashboard is functioning correctly
4. Consider using Docker Compose profiles to better manage container dependencies

## Conclusion
The implemented solution provides a reliable way to run the Vue Dashboard outside of Docker Compose, ensuring it works correctly with the proper port configuration. This approach should be more resilient to system restarts and provide a consistent way to manage the Vue Dashboard container.
