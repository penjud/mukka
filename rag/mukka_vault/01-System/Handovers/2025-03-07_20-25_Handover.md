## Current Status
- Conducted comprehensive testing of the MCP deployment
- Created both basic connectivity test and functional test scripts
- Identified several integration issues that need to be addressed
- Most MCP services are operational but with some functional limitations

## Completed Tasks
- Created `test-mcp-services.sh` script for basic connectivity testing
- Created `functional-tests.sh` script for detailed functionality testing
- Verified all services are running and accessible on their respective ports
- Fixed authentication issues with the Auth Server (password was "admin123")
- Successfully tested and confirmed Brave Search functionality

## Test Results Summary
Basic connectivity tests:
- All services are responding on their respective ports
- Service registry shows most services are registered with the Base Server
- Only Ollama service is not registered (expected as it's running as system service)
- Authentication with Auth Server is working with correct credentials

Functional tests:
- Memory MCP: **PARTIAL PASS**
  - Can create conversations
  - Can add messages
  - Cannot retrieve messages (404 error when accessing the messages endpoint)
- Filesystem MCP: **FAIL**
  - Unable to browse files
  - Possible API path or authentication issue
- Brave Search MCP: **PASS**
  - Successfully performs web searches
  - Returns expected result format
- Ollama Bridge: **PARTIAL PASS**
  - API prefix discovered (`/api`)
  - Authentication issues when accessing the API

## Known Issues
1. **Memory MCP**: Conversations can be created and messages added, but retrieving messages fails with 404
   - API endpoint might be incorrect or needs a different path structure

2. **Filesystem MCP**: File browsing functionality not accessible
   - API endpoint may be incorrect or not exposed properly
   - Could be an authentication issue

3. **Ollama Bridge**: Authentication issues when trying to list models
   - Returns "Unauthorized" error despite valid authentication token
   - May require a different authentication mechanism

4. **API Paths**: Inconsistent API path usage across services
   - Some services (like Ollama Bridge) use `/api` prefix
   - Others don't use any prefix
   - Need to standardize or document each service's API structure

## Next Steps
1. **Memory MCP**:
   - Investigate message retrieval endpoint issues
   - Check if proper versioning is in place for API routes

2. **Filesystem MCP**:
   - Debug file browsing functionality issues
   - Examine authentication mechanism requirements

3. **Ollama Bridge**:
   - Fix authentication issues for model listing and chat functionality
   - Verify if token-based authentication is properly implemented

4. **Documentation**:
   - Document correct API endpoints for all services
   - Create a comprehensive API reference guide
   - Update test scripts with any findings

## Resources
- The test scripts are located in the project root:
  - `/home/mothership/mukka/test-mcp-services.sh` (basic connectivity test)
  - `/home/mothership/mukka/functional-tests.sh` (functional test)
- Deployment summary and checklist are available in the root directory
- Project status is maintained in `/home/mothership/mukka/rag/mukka_vault/01-System/Project Status/MCP_Project_Status.md`
