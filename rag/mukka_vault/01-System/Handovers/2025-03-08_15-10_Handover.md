## Current Status Summary
- Successfully fixed Vue Dashboard port configuration and startup issues
- Implemented an automatic startup solution for Vue Dashboard using desktop autostart
- Created comprehensive documentation for the Vue Dashboard configuration
- Reorganized and standardized naming conventions in the handover documents
- All MCP components are now operational and correctly configured
- Vue Dashboard is accessible at http://localhost:3002

## Completed Tasks
- Fixed Vue Dashboard port configuration:
  - Modified nginx.conf to listen on port 80 instead of port 3002
  - Updated Dockerfile to expose port 80 instead of port 3002
  - Ensured proper port mapping in Docker (host 3002 â†’ container 80)
- Implemented automatic startup solution:
  - Created a desktop autostart entry at `~/.config/autostart/mukka-vue-dashboard.desktop`
  - Enhanced the startup script to wait for Docker Desktop availability
  - Added retry mechanism to ensure reliable startup after system boot
- Created detailed documentation:
  - VUE-DASHBOARD-README.md with technical details and troubleshooting steps
  - README-DEPLOYMENT.md in the frontend/vue-dashboard directory
  - Handover document with comprehensive details of the solution
- Renamed handover documents to follow standard naming convention:
  - Standardized to YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM_Description.md format
  - Applied consistent naming across all handover documents
- All changes committed and pushed to GitHub repository

## Technical Issues Addressed
1. **Vue Dashboard Port Configuration Issue** - FIXED:
   - Identified mismatch between container port mapping and nginx configuration
   - Resolved by updating nginx.conf to listen on port 80 instead of 3002
   - Verified solution works correctly by testing HTTP access to http://localhost:3002

2. **Vue Dashboard Startup Issue** - FIXED:
   - Implemented desktop autostart entry to launch Vue Dashboard after login
   - Created robust startup script with Docker Desktop detection and retry logic
   - Verified container starts reliably after system reboot

3. **Naming Convention Inconsistency** - FIXED:
   - Standardized handover document naming to follow the established pattern
   - Renamed recent handover documents to maintain consistency

## Environment Configuration
- Vue Dashboard: http://localhost:3002 (primary UI)
- Base MCP Server: http://localhost:8090
- Memory MCP Server: http://localhost:8094
- Filesystem MCP Server: http://localhost:8095
- Brave Search MCP Server: http://localhost:8096
- Auth MCP Server: http://localhost:8097
- Ollama Bridge: http://localhost:8082

## Next Steps
1. **Comprehensive Testing**:
   - Test all MCP services integration with the Vue Dashboard
   - Verify conversation history in Memory MCP
   - Test file browsing in Filesystem MCP
   - Test web search with Brave Search MCP
   - Test model switching with Ollama Bridge

2. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Create system architecture diagram
   - Document environment variable configurations
   - Create user guides for each service
   - Document troubleshooting procedures

3. **Future Improvements**:
   - Investigate why Docker Compose doesn't recognize the vue-dashboard service
   - Consider creating a more robust systemd service for Docker Desktop integration
   - Implement container health checks
   - Create automated testing scripts

All critical issues have been resolved. The system is now fully operational and configured for reliable use.
