# Project Handover - 2025-03-07 13:40

## Current Status
We've set up the Obsidian vault structure and begun creating the Docker Compose configuration for the MCP services. The basic directory structure for the backend is in place, and we're in the process of defining the Docker Compose services.

## Last Completed Tasks
- Created project folder structure
- Set up Obsidian vault with templates and knowledge organization
- Created Snippets directory for preserving important information
- Added the Handover Process snippet
- Started creating Docker Compose configuration
- Created backend directory structure for services

## Next Steps
- Complete Docker Compose configuration
- Create individual service configurations
- Set up Ollama integration
- Configure JWT authentication
- Configure logging
- Set up Obsidian vault integration with Filesystem MCP

## Context
- The project is located at `/home/mothership/mukka/`
- We're using Docker Compose for containerization
- Authentication will use JWT
- We're integrating Ollama models (llama3.1:8b, dolphin-mistral:7b, NeuralDaredevil-8B-abliterated)
- Docker Desktop is installed and being used
