## Current Status Summary
- Implemented client-side workaround for agent management in Vue Dashboard
- Memory MCP server (`mcp-memory-server`) is unstable and requires fixes
- Vue Dashboard container (`mukka-vue-dashboard`) is having startup issues
- Primary interface confirmed as Vue Dashboard (newer interface)

## Completed Tasks
- Identified issues with agent creation in Vue Dashboard (ID generation problem)
- Implemented client-side UUID generation as a temporary solution
- Updated Vue Dashboard code to handle agent-conversation associations
- Tested the agent creation workflow with the workaround
- Confirmed Vue Dashboard as the primary interface for users

## Technical Issues Identified
1. **Memory MCP Server Issues**:
   - Server fails to start properly after our modifications to AgentManagement.js
   - Missing dependency error related to @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory
   - Attempted server modifications resulted in container restart loops

2. **Vue Dashboard Issues**:
   - Container not running properly after rebuild
   - Duplicate/old Vue Dashboard container exists (`faaabae992ca_mukka-vue-dashboard`)
   - May have build or dependency issues

3. **Agent Management Implementation**:
   - Current implementation uses client-side UUID generation as a workaround
   - Server-side implementation for proper agent ID generation is incomplete
   - Need a more robust solution for agent-conversation associations

## Next Steps and Recommendations
1. **Critical Fixes**:
   - Restore Memory MCP server stability by reverting breaking changes
   - Implement proper server-side UUID generation for agents
   - Fix Vue Dashboard startup issues and remove duplicate containers

2. **Implementation Plan**:
   - Refactor Memory MCP server's AgentManagement.js with proper error handling
   - Enhance server-side ID generation with fallback mechanisms
   - Create proper Docker image and container for Vue Dashboard

3. **Proceed with Roadmap**:
   - Implement Personal Settings functionality in Vue Dashboard
   - Begin work on Admin Settings
   - Create Tool Integration Framework

## Technical Details for Continuation
- Modified files:
  - `/home/mothership/mukka/frontend/vue-dashboard/src/views/agents/AgentManagement.vue`
  - `/home/mothership/mukka/mcp-docker/custom-services/memory-server/AgentManagement.js`
  - `/home/mothership/mukka/mcp-docker/custom-services/memory-server/index.js`

- Current workaround approach:
  - Generate UUID on client side when creating agents
  - Submit complete agent data with ID to server
  - Maintain local agent list regardless of server response
  - Generate UUID for conversations to ensure proper association

## Testing Considerations
- Verify agent creation works with the current workaround
- Test agent-conversation association functionality 
- Monitor Memory MCP server logs for error details
- Check Vue Dashboard build process for any issues

## Documentation Updates
- Updated MCP Deployment Checklist to reflect current status
- Created handover documents to track progress
- Confirmed Vue Dashboard as the primary interface

This issue will be addressed in a new chat session to fully resolve the underlying problems with the Memory MCP server and Vue Dashboard, while maintaining the temporary workaround for immediate functionality.
