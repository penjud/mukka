- Integrated with authentication store and MCP Auth Server
- Updated configuration files and documentation

## Technical Implementation
- Created layout components:
  - AuthLayout.vue for authentication pages
  - AppLayout.vue for the main application
- Implemented authentication views:
  - Login.vue with validation
  - Register.vue with form validation
  - ForgotPassword.vue for password recovery

## Deployment Status
- Built a new Vue dashboard Docker image with updated code
- Attempted to deploy the updated container
- Encountered Docker connectivity issues
- Need to run the Docker container manually: 
  ```bash
  docker run -d --name mukka-vue-dashboard --network mukka-network -p 3002:3002 mukka_vue-dashboard
  ```

## Next Steps
1. Deploy the updated Vue dashboard container
2. Test authentication flow against Auth Server
3. Implement WebSocket support for real-time chat
4. Add profile image upload functionality 
5. Create agent trait impact on system prompts
6. Enable conversation storage in Memory MCP
