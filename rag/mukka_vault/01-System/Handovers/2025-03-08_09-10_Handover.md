## Completed Tasks
- Successfully deployed Agent Management functionality to Memory MCP server
- Created and implemented AgentManagement.js class
- Updated Memory MCP server to include agent API endpoints
- Added agent-conversation association functionality
- Tested Agent Management API endpoints

## Technical Implementation Details
- **Agent Management Implementation**:
  - Added AgentManagement.js class to Memory MCP server
  - Integrated agent management with conversation history
  - Added API endpoints at /api/agents
  - Implemented agent-conversation association
  - Added system prompt generation based on traits and expertise

- **API Endpoints Added**:
  - GET /api/agents - Get all agents
  - GET /api/agents/:id - Get specific agent
  - POST /api/agents - Create new agent
  - PUT /api/agents/:id - Update agent
  - DELETE /api/agents/:id - Delete agent
  - GET /api/agents/:id/systemPrompt - Get system prompt
  - GET /api/agents/:id/conversations - Get agent conversations

- **Agent-Conversation Association**:
  - Added agentId parameter to conversation creation/update
  - Added functionality to filter conversations by agent
  - Added agent metadata to conversation objects

## Testing Results
- Successfully created test agent via API
- Confirmed agent retrieval works
- Verified agent properties are correctly stored
- Tested system prompt generation based on traits and expertise

## Next Steps
1. **Complete Personal Settings Implementation**:
   - User profile configuration
   - Appearance settings
   - Notification preferences
   - Regional settings (timezone, language)

2. **Begin Admin Settings Implementation**:
   - User management interface
   - System configuration
   - Service monitoring dashboard
   - Agent template management

3. **Create Tool Integration Framework**:
   - Auto-triggering system for Brave Search
   - File browser integration
   - Memory graph visualizer
   - Tool selection interface

## Technical Notes
- Agent information is stored in /app/data/memory/agents.json in the Memory MCP container
- For testing agent functionality, use curl or Postman with base URL http://localhost:8094/api/agents
- When creating a conversation with an agent, include the agentId in the request body
- To get conversations for a specific agent, use the endpoint /api/agents/:id/conversations
- To get the system prompt for an agent, use the endpoint /api/agents/:id/systemPrompt

## Troubleshooting Tips
- If an agent can't be found, check the ID in the URL
- For agent creation issues, ensure the request body includes at least a name
- To update an agent, make sure to use PUT not PATCH
- The system prompt is generated from traits and expertise if not explicitly provided
- Check the Memory MCP server logs with `docker logs mukka-mcp-memory-server` for any errors
