## Current Status
- Standardized configuration using a single `.env` file for all components
- Web UI implementation properly configured with the cloned repository
- Updated docker-compose.yml to use environment variables throughout
- Created comprehensive redeploy script with environment variable management
- Addressed port conflict with Ollama container

## Completed Tasks
- Consolidated all environment variables into a single `.env` file
- Updated all configuration files to reference environment variables:
  - docker-compose.yml
  - frontend/web-ui/config.yaml
  - redeploy.sh
- Cloned the actual `penjud/mcp-web-ui` repository and configured it properly
- Enhanced the redeploy script to create a default `.env` file if missing
- Updated container networking to use service names instead of localhost references

## Environment Variable Structure
The `.env` file now includes comprehensive settings for:
- Authentication tokens (MCP_AUTH_TOKEN, JWT_SECRET)
- API keys (BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY)
- Port configurations for all services 
- File paths for data storage
- Network settings for container communication

## Next Steps
1. Run the redeploy script to start all containers with standardized naming:
   ```bash
   cd /home/mothership/mukka
   ./redeploy.sh
   ```

2. Test the complete MCP stack:
   - Connect to Web UI at http://localhost:3001
   - Test conversation history in Memory MCP
   - Test file browsing in Filesystem MCP
   - Test Ollama with model switching

3. Complete remaining documentation:
   - Update system architecture diagram
   - Document environment variable configurations
   - Create user guides for each service

## Project Structure
All components follow a standardized structure under `/home/mothership/mukka/`:
- `backend/services/` - Contains all MCP service implementations
- `frontend/web-ui/` - Contains the cloned MCP Web UI implementation
- `rag/mukka_vault/` - Contains documentation and notes
- `.env` - Single source of truth for all environment variables
- `docker-compose.yml` - Defines the complete containerized stack
- `redeploy.sh` - Script to rebuild and redeploy all containers

## Notes
- The redeploy script will automatically create a default `.env` file if one doesn't exist
- Environment variables in the `.env` file will be used by all components
- Service URLs in the docker-compose.yml use internal container names for proper networking
- Web UI configuration is properly mounted as a volume in the container
