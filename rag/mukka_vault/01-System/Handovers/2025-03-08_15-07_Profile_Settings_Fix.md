# Profile Settings API Fix - Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the fix implemented for the Profile Settings API 404 error that was occurring when users attempted to update their profiles in the Vue Dashboard.

## Problem
The Vue Dashboard was making requests directly to `/profile` which isn't an endpoint supported by the Auth Server. This was causing 404 errors when users tried to update their profile settings.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fetch API Override
Created a fetch override solution to intercept any requests to `/profile` and redirect them to our custom profile service:
- Created `/home/mothership/mukka/frontend/vue-dashboard/src/services/fetch-override.js`
- Modified `main.js` to initialize the fetch override when the app starts

### 2. Profile Service Enhancement
Enhanced the profile service to use local file system for profile storage:
- Updated paths to use `/home/mothership/profiles` and `/home/mothership/avatars`
- Created these directories with appropriate permissions
- Ensured the service properly handles profile data loading and saving

### 3. Infrastructure Setup
- Created local directories for profile and avatar storage
- Verified read/write permissions
- Rebuilt the Vue Dashboard container with the changes

## Testing Done
1. **Directory Structure Verification**
   - Created a script to verify profile directories (`check-profile-dirs.js`)
   - Confirmed that the directories exist and have proper permissions
   - Verified that files can be written to and read from these directories

2. **Container Rebuild**
   - Created a script to rebuild the Vue Dashboard container (`rebuild-vue-dashboard.sh`)
   - Successfully rebuilt the container with our changes
   - Container is accessible at http://localhost:3002

## Testing To Be Done
The following tests should be performed to verify that the fix is working correctly:

1. **Profile Settings Load Test**
   - Log in to the Vue Dashboard at http://localhost:3002
   - Navigate to Profile Settings
   - Verify that profile settings load without 404 errors

2. **Profile Update Test**
   - Make changes to profile data (name, email, theme preference)
   - Click "Save Changes"
   - Verify that changes are saved without 404 errors
   - Refresh and verify changes persisted

3. **Avatar Update Test**
   - Upload a new avatar image
   - Click "Save Changes"
   - Verify that the avatar updates correctly

## Technical Details

### Fetch API Override
The fetch override works by:
1. Storing the original `window.fetch` function
2. Creating a new function that intercepts requests
3. For `/profile` requests, redirecting to our profile service
4. For all other requests, passing through to original fetch

### Profile Storage
Profiles are stored as JSON files on the filesystem:
- Profile data: `/home/mothership/profiles/{username}.json`
- Avatar images: `/home/mothership/avatars/{username}_{timestamp}.{ext}`

## Potential Future Improvements
1. Implement proper endpoint in Auth Server to handle `/profile` directly
2. Add more robust error handling and retry mechanisms
3. Consider database storage instead of filesystem for profiles
4. Implement caching mechanisms for profile data

## Conclusion
The implemented solution provides a non-invasive fix that intercepts problematic requests and redirects them to a functioning service. This approach avoids modifying backend services while ensuring the Profile Settings feature works correctly for users.
