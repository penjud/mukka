## Current Status Summary
- Successfully consolidated Docker environment into a single compose stack
- Memory MCP Server is functioning properly with working Agent Management API
- Conversations can be created and associated with agents
- Vue Dashboard and Web UI are still having issues

## Completed Tasks
- Stopped and removed all containers to eliminate duplicate compose stacks
- Started single clean compose stack with the `mukka` prefix
- Verified all core MCP services are running (base, memory, filesystem, brave search, auth, ollama bridge)
- Successfully tested agent and conversation creation
- Successfully associated conversations with agents
- Successfully added messages to conversations

## Technical Issues Identified
1. **Web UI Issues**:
   - Web UI container is failing to start with an error: `function "formatTime" not defined`
   - The Vue Dashboard container seems to be running but not accessible

2. **API Endpoint Differences**:
   - The memory server's API structure seems to have changed
   - Previous endpoints for conversation creation have changed from `/mcp/v1/memory/conversation` to `/conversations`
   - Agent-conversation association has to be done through agent update rather than a dedicated endpoint

## Testing Results
- **Memory Server API**:
  - `/health` - Returns healthy status
  - `/api/agents` - Properly returns all agents
  - `/conversations` - Returns all conversations
  - Creating and updating agents works correctly
  - Creating conversations with agent metadata works correctly
  - Adding messages to conversations works correctly

## Next Steps and Recommendations
1. **UI Fixes**:
   - Investigate and fix the Web UI container error related to the missing formatTime function
   - Check why the Vue Dashboard is not accessible

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test the filesystem server
   - Test the Brave Search server
   - Test Ollama with model switching

3. **Documentation**:
   - Update API documentation to reflect the current endpoint structure
   - Create a system architecture diagram
   - Document environment variable configurations
