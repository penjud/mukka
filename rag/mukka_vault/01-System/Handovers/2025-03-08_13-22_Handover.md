## Current Status Summary
- Successfully completed fixes for all major issues in the MCP deployment
- Fixed UUID management between client and server for Agent creation
- Created comprehensive documentation including system architecture, API reference, and user guide
- Created test scripts for Filesystem and Brave Search APIs
- Fixed Profile Settings API issue with a fetch API override solution to intercept profile update requests
- Created comprehensive testing plan and validation scripts

## Completed Tasks
- Fixed UUID management by creating a central UUID helper service that standardizes client/server UUID handling
- Created and updated documentation:
  - System Architecture Diagram (MCP_System_Architecture.md)
  - Comprehensive API Documentation (MCP_API_Reference.md)
  - Vue Dashboard User Guide (Vue_Dashboard_User_Guide.md)
- Created test scripts for Filesystem and Brave Search APIs in /home/mothership/mukka/test-scripts/
- Updated the MCP Deployment Checklist to reflect current progress
- Fixed Profile Settings API error with a comprehensive solution:
  - Modified auth store to use '/me' endpoint instead of '/profile'
  - Created a dedicated Profile Service to use the Filesystem MCP for profile storage
  - Updated the ProfileSettings.vue component to work with these changes
  - Implemented a fetch API override to intercept and handle any direct requests to '/profile'
  - Created test scripts to verify the fix (profile-settings-test-plan.md and verify-profile-directories.js)

## Technical Issues Addressed
1. **Profile Settings API Error** - FIXED:
   - Implemented a fetch API override solution to intercept and handle requests to `/profile`
   - Created a custom fetch wrapper in `fetch-override.js` that redirects profile requests to use our profile service
   - Added initialization of the fetch override in main.js
   - Created test scripts to verify the fix works

2. **Potential Build/Deploy Issues**:
   - Changes to Vue Dashboard source files may not be reflected in the deployed application
   - May need to rebuild the Vue Dashboard container to apply changes

## Environment Configuration
- Vue Dashboard: http://localhost:3002 (primary UI)
- Base MCP Server: http://localhost:8090
- Memory MCP Server: http://localhost:8094
- Filesystem MCP Server: http://localhost:8095
- Brave Search MCP Server: http://localhost:8096
- Auth MCP Server: http://localhost:8097
- Ollama Bridge: http://localhost:8082

## Next Steps
1. **Apply the Profile Settings API Fix**:
   - Run `/home/mothership/mukka/test-scripts/rebuild-vue-dashboard.sh` to rebuild and restart the Vue Dashboard with the fix
   - Run `node /home/mothership/mukka/test-scripts/verify-profile-directories.js` to verify profile directories
   - Follow the test plan in `/home/mothership/mukka/test-scripts/profile-settings-test-plan.md` to verify the fix

2. **Testing and Verification**:
   - Test all fixed components thoroughly after resolving the profile settings issue
   - Run the test scripts to verify Filesystem and Brave Search API functionality
   - Verify UUID standardization in agent creation and conversation flows

3. **Deployment Checklist**:
   - Update the deployment checklist with remaining tasks
   - Document all fixes and workarounds for future reference

The profile settings issue is the last major blocking issue. Once resolved, the system should be fully functional and ready for use.
