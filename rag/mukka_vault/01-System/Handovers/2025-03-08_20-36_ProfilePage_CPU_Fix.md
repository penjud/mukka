## Issue Summary
Two critical issues were addressed:
1. The profile settings page was causing severe CPU spikes when loaded, making the page slow and unresponsive. This was particularly problematic when users attempted to save profile changes, as the button would get stuck in a "Saving..." state.
2. The MCP Service Status panel was appearing below every page, which was not desired in the UI.

## Root Cause Analysis
After thorough investigation, we identified:

### For the CPU spike issue:
- The primary cause was in `profile-button-remover.js`, which contained aggressive DOM manipulation code that continuously scanned for buttons on the profile page.
- The script used a MutationObserver to watch for DOM changes and forcefully modify button elements.
- When combined with Vuetify's reactive button states, this created a feedback loop of DOM changes and mutations, leading to CPU spikes.
- Additional problematic components included `profile-update-fix.js` that was also attempting to modify fetching behavior.

### For the MCP Service Status panel:
- This was being included in both main layouts (`AppLayout.vue` and `AuthLayout.vue`) by importing and using the `ServiceStatus.vue` component in their footers.

## Solution Implemented

### For the CPU spike issue:
1. **Complete Button Replacement:**
   - Rewrote `ProfileSettings.vue` to use plain HTML form submission instead of Vuetify buttons
   - Replaced all `v-btn` components with standard HTML `input[type="submit"]` elements
   - Added custom styling for these elements to maintain the UI look and feel

2. **Script Neutralization:**
   - Completely emptied the contents of `profile-button-remover.js` 
   - Emptied `profile-update-fix.js` to prevent its execution
   - Added safety timeout mechanisms to ensure the profile page states don't get stuck

3. **Simplified State Management:**
   - Streamlined the profile update workflow
   - Implemented direct form submission rather than reactive button handling
   - Added fallback mechanisms for error states

### For the MCP Service Status panel:
1. **Removed from Layouts:**
   - Removed ServiceStatus component from `AppLayout.vue` and `AuthLayout.vue`
   - Created a new `SimpleFooter.vue` component with minimal design
   - Updated both layouts to use the new SimpleFooter component

2. **Preserved Dashboard Functionality:**
   - Maintained the service discovery system for the dashboard
   - Kept the service status display in the Dashboard view where it's contextually appropriate

## Files Modified
1. `/home/mothership/mukka/frontend/vue-dashboard/src/views/settings/ProfileSettings.vue`:
   - Complete rewrite to use standard HTML forms and remove all v-btn usage
   - Added safety timeouts and simplified state management

2. `/home/mothership/mukka/frontend/vue-dashboard/src/views/settings/profile-button-remover.js`:
   - Emptied file contents and documented the reason for disabling

3. `/home/mothership/mukka/frontend/vue-dashboard/src/views/settings/profile-update-fix.js`:
   - Emptied file contents and documented the reason for disabling

4. `/home/mothership/mukka/frontend/vue-dashboard/src/layouts/AppLayout.vue`:
   - Removed ServiceStatus component
   - Added SimpleFooter component

5. `/home/mothership/mukka/frontend/vue-dashboard/src/layouts/AuthLayout.vue`:
   - Removed ServiceStatus component
   - Added SimpleFooter component

6. `/home/mothership/mukka/frontend/vue-dashboard/src/components/SimpleFooter.vue`:
   - Created new file with basic footer design and copyright information

## Testing Performed
- Verified profile page loads without CPU spikes
- Confirmed profile data can be saved successfully
- Checked that the profile page works correctly across different browsers
- Verified that the MCP Service Status panel no longer appears at the bottom of all pages
- Confirmed that the simple footer appears correctly on all pages
- Checked that service status information still displays correctly on the Dashboard

## Future Considerations
1. **Code Cleanup:**
   - Consider removing the problematic JS files entirely from the repository
   - Review and refactor other components that might use similar DOM manipulation techniques

2. **Architectural Improvements:**
   - Avoid direct DOM manipulation in favor of Vue's reactive patterns
   - Implement proper error boundaries for component state management
   - Consider using more native HTML components where appropriate to reduce complexity

3. **Testing Improvements:**
   - Add performance monitoring to detect similar CPU usage issues
   - Implement automated tests for the profile page to catch regressions
