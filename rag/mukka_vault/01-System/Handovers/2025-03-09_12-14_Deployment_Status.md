# MCP Deployment Status Update

## Current Status

The MCP system is now fully deployed and operational with the following components:

### Running Docker Containers
- Base MCP Server (`mukka-mcp-base-server`) - Port 8090
- Memory MCP Server (`mukka-mcp-memory-server`) - Port 8094
- Filesystem MCP Server (`mukka-mcp-filesystem-server`) - Port 8095
- Brave Search MCP Server (`mukka-mcp-brave-search-server`) - Port 8096
- Ollama Bridge (`mukka-mcp-ollama-bridge`) - Port 8082
- Web UI (`mukka-vue-dashboard`) - Port 3002

### Direct Process
- Auth MCP Server - Running directly on the host on Port 8097
  - Process ID: 803792
  - Command: `node src/index.js`
  - Working Directory: `/home/mothership/mukka/backend/services/auth`

### External Services
- MongoDB - Running as a system service on Port 27017
  - Version: 7.0.17
  - Status: Active

## Auth Server Status

The Auth Server with MongoDB integration has been fixed and is now functioning correctly. The key fixes included:

1. **Enhanced Password Verification**:
   - Added defensive checking for password format
   - Added error handling around bcrypt operations
   - Added detailed logging for troubleshooting

2. **Reset Admin Password**:
   - Reset the admin user's password to "admin123"
   - Ensured the password hash is in the correct format

3. **Direct Deployment**:
   - Running the auth server directly on the host to avoid container segmentation faults
   - This provides better stability while the Docker container issue is investigated further

## Verification Status

All components are working correctly:

- The auth server health endpoint returns a "healthy" status
- Login with admin/admin123 is successful
- The Web UI is accessible at http://localhost:3002
- MongoDB integration is functioning correctly

## Next Steps

1. **Docker Container Fix**:
   - Investigate why the auth server container experiences segmentation faults
   - Create a more robust Docker setup for the auth server

2. **Monitoring**:
   - Set up monitoring for the auth server process
   - Implement automatic restart if the auth server crashes

3. **Documentation**:
   - Document the auth server deployment approach
   - Update system architecture diagrams

## Notes

The current deployment has the auth server running directly on the host instead of in a Docker container. This is a temporary solution until the container segmentation fault issue is resolved. The rest of the system is running in Docker containers as intended.

## Access Information

- **Web UI**: http://localhost:3002
- **Auth Server**: http://localhost:8097
- **Default Admin Credentials**: Username: `admin`, Password: `admin123`
