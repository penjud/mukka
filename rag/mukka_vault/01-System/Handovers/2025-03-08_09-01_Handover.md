## Current Status
- Successfully implemented Personal Workspace functionality in Vue Dashboard
- Implemented Agent Management UI in Vue Dashboard
- Created backend code for Agent Management service (agentManagement.js)
- Added API endpoints for agent management in Memory MCP server
- Updated conversation APIs to support agent association
- Updated MCP Deployment Checklist to mark Agent Management as complete

## Technical Implementation Status
- **Frontend Implementation**:
  - Agent Management UI is complete and integrated into Vue Dashboard
  - Model selection fetches from Ollama Bridge
  - Agent creation/editing/deletion workflows implemented
  - Persona traits and expertise selection implemented
  - System prompt editor added

- **Backend Implementation**:
  - Agent Management service code created but not yet deployed to container
  - API endpoints defined but not yet accessible
  - Conversation endpoints updated to include agent associations
  - Memory MCP server changes ready but need to be deployed

## Deployment Status
All MCP services are running:
  - Base Server (8090)
  - Memory Server (8094)
  - Filesystem Server (8095)
  - Brave Search Server (8096)
  - Auth Server (8097)
  - Ollama Bridge (8082)
  - Web UI (3001)
  - Vue Dashboard (3002)

## Implementation Gaps
Agent Management functionality is not yet fully operational due to the following gaps:
1. Memory MCP server needs the new AgentManagement.js file deployed to container
2. Memory MCP server index.js needs to include the new agent API endpoints
3. Memory MCP container needs to be rebuilt and restarted with these changes

## Next Steps
1. **Complete Agent Management Implementation**:
   - Deploy Memory MCP server changes to the container
   - Verify agent API endpoints are accessible
   - Test agent creation/management workflow
   - Ensure conversation-agent association works correctly

2. **Begin Personal Settings Implementation**:
   - User profile configuration
   - Appearance settings
   - Notification preferences
   - Regional settings (timezone, language)

3. **Begin Admin Settings Implementation**:
   - User management interface
   - System configuration
   - Service monitoring dashboard
   - Agent template management

## Technical Notes
- Agent storage is implemented using JSON files in the Memory MCP container
- Agent management uses a similar approach to conversation management
- Each agent has a unique ID and can be associated with conversations
- Agent traits and expertise are implemented as arrays in the agent object
- The system prompt is customizable per agent
- Conversations can reference an agent's ID for personalized interactions

## Troubleshooting Tips
- If experiencing issues with the Memory MCP container, check that the AgentManagement.js file is properly deployed
- For agent creation issues, verify the API endpoints at /api/agents are accessible
- If agent traits or expertise aren't being saved, check the request payload format
- For UI issues, check the Vue Dashboard logs with `docker logs mukka-vue-dashboard`
- After modifying Memory MCP server code, rebuild with `docker build -t mukka_mcp-memory-server .` and restart the container
