## Overview

This handover documents the complete rebuild of the ProfileSettings page to resolve persistent CPU usage spikes. The ProfileSettings page was causing severe CPU utilization issues that previous fixes were unable to resolve. A fresh approach with minimal reactivity and simplified architecture has been implemented.

## Background

The Vue Dashboard's ProfileSettings page was experiencing critical CPU usage spikes making the application unresponsive. Previous fixes in handovers `2025-03-08_19-41_ProfileSettings_Button_Fix.md` and `2025-03-08_20-36_ProfilePage_CPU_Fix.md` provided temporary solutions but didn't fully resolve the underlying problems.

A complete rebuild approach was determined to be the only effective solution after extended debugging.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Complete Removal of Old Implementation

The following problematic files were completely removed:
- `src/views/settings/profile-button-remover.js`
- `src/views/settings/profile-update-fix.js`

### 2. Simplified Component Architecture

The ProfileSettings page was rebuilt with a minimalist approach:
- Eliminated complex reactivity patterns
- Removed deep nesting of components
- Used simple form submission instead of reactive button updates
- Removed all direct DOM manipulation
- Minimized computed properties and watchers

### 3. Docker Integration

A key insight was that modifications to local files require Docker container rebuilding to take effect. The solution involved:
- Rebuilding the Vue Dashboard Docker image
- Removing the outdated container reference
- Starting a new container with the updated code

### 4. Key Technical Changes

- Simplified markup with minimal nesting
- Eliminated reliance on problematic Vuetify buttons that triggered reactivity cascades
- Implemented simple, controlled state management
- Used native HTML form elements with custom styling
- Added timeouts to prevent permanent loading states

## Files Modified

1. `/home/mothership/mukka/frontend/vue-dashboard/src/views/settings/ProfileSettings.vue`:
   - Complete rewrite with simplified architecture
   - Reduced component complexity
   - Implemented straightforward data flow

2. Docker-related changes:
   - Rebuilt Docker image for `vue-dashboard` service
   - Updated container deployment

## Testing Performed

- Verified profile page loads without CPU spikes
- Confirmed form submission works correctly
- Verified state updates properly without cascading reactivity issues
- Confirmed Docker container runs with updated code

## Deployment Notes

The deployment process required special attention to Docker container management:
1. Changes to source files needed to be incorporated into the Docker image
2. Previous container references to old image IDs had to be removed
3. A new container with the updated image had to be started

## Future Considerations

1. **Code Structure Improvements**:
   - Consider extracting simplified service interfaces
   - Implement proper state persistence with Pinia
   - Add more granular error handling

2. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - Add CPU usage monitoring for early detection of similar issues
   - Implement Vue DevTools performance tracking
   - Consider adding automated performance tests

3. **Docker Workflow Optimization**:
   - Consider implementing volume mounting for development
   - Establish clear protocols for container rebuilds
   - Document Docker deployment steps clearly for future developers
