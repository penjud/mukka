# Handover - March 7, 2025 (15:37)

## Project Status Summary
- Successfully set up MCP Docker environment with filesystem, memory, and web UI services
- Integrated services are running and accessible (web UI on port 3001, filesystem on 8091, memory on 8092)
- Initialized Git repository in the mukka directory for version control
- Prepared repository for GitHub backup (pending push with authentication)

## Current Issues
- MCP Web UI is running but tools are not showing up in the interface
- Needs GitHub authentication configuration to complete backup

## Next Steps
1. **GitHub Backup**:
   - Complete pushing to GitHub using Personal Access Token or SSH key
   - Follow updated instructions provided for modern GitHub authentication

2. **Troubleshoot MCP Web UI**:
   - Investigate why tools aren't displaying in the UI
   - Check environment variables and service configuration
   - Verify API connectivity between web UI and backend services

3. **Service Enhancement**:
   - Add Brave Search capability once core functionality is working
   - Improve documentation
   - Consider adding monitoring and logging

## Environment Details
- Docker services running on ports:
  - Web UI: 3001
  - Filesystem: 8091
  - Memory: 8092
- Configuration files located in: `config/` directory
- Data persistence in: `data/filesystem` and `data/memory`

## Notes
The project follows a modular architecture with filesystem and memory services providing capability to the web UI. The Docker Compose setup ensures these services can communicate with each other.
