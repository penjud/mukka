## Current Status
- Fixed port configuration mismatches in `.env` file and Docker Compose
- Updated Vue dashboard configuration to match updated ports
- Created new Vue dashboard container with proper Nginx configuration
- Successfully deployed all MCP services and the Vue dashboard
- Stopped conflicting mcp-web-ui-custom container
- Created detailed implementation plan for agent-based workspace

## Technical Implementation
- Docker containers running for all MCP services:
  - Base MCP Server (8090)
  - Memory MCP Server (8094)
  - Filesystem MCP Server (8095)
  - Brave Search MCP Server (8096)
  - Ollama Bridge (8082)
  - Auth Server (8097)
  - Vue Dashboard (3002)
- Vue dashboard built with:
  - Vue 3 with Composition API
  - Vue Router for navigation
  - MCP API service for backend communication
  - Service discovery module for health checking
  - Nginx for serving static files and API proxying

## Component Development Plan
- Authentication system with login/registration
- Personal workspace with agent selection
- Agent management with personality traits
- Personal settings for user profiles
- Admin settings for system configuration
- Automatic tool triggering system

## Next Steps
1. Implement authentication flow (login, registration)
2. Create personal workspace with chat interface
3. Build agent creation and management UI
4. Implement agent personality traits system
5. Connect agent system to Ollama for model switching
6. Create profile settings interface
7. Implement auto-triggering for MCP tools

## Infrastructure Status
- All Docker containers running and healthy
- Docker network configured properly
- Vue dashboard deployed and accessible at http://localhost:3002
- Original MCP Web UI stopped to avoid conflicts

## API Integration
- Vue dashboard configured to proxy requests to:
  - Base MCP at /api/base/
  - Memory MCP at /api/memory/
  - Filesystem MCP at /api/filesystem/
  - Brave Search at /api/brave-search/
  - Ollama Bridge at /api/ollama/
  - Auth Server at /api/auth/
- Configured WebSocket support for Ollama Bridge
- Added SSE support for real-time updates

## Documentation
- Updated implementation checklist with new tasks
- Created modular frontend architecture plan
- Documented Docker container status
- Prepared handover document

## Known Issues
- Vue dashboard currently lacks authentication
- Agent system needs to be implemented
- Needs WebSocket integration for real-time chat
- Profile system to be integrated with Memory MCP
- Tool auto-triggering system to be implemented

## Resources
- Original flowchart design for reference
- Updated MCP deployment checklist
- Docker Compose configuration
