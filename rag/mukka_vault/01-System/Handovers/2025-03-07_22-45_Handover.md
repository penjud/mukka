## Current Status
- Conducted analysis of MCP Web UI integration challenges
- Found that the frontend is built with Go, with static files embedded at build time
- Attempted to modify the frontend by adding JavaScript files but faced compilation constraints
- Explored alternative approaches for MCP UI implementation
- Investigated OpenWebUI as a potential replacement but encountered endpoint compatibility issues

## Technical Constraints
- MCP Web UI compiles templates and static assets into a single binary at build time
- Our JavaScript modifications (auth.js, mcp-api.js, etc.) cannot be included without recompilation
- Current UI is displaying as a shell, with no working functionality
- API endpoints are functional but UI is not properly connecting to them

## Explored Solutions
- Rebuilding the Go application with our new files included
- Using a proxy/middleware approach to intercept and modify responses
- Investigating community projects like Open WebUI and MegaGrindStone MCP UI
- Exploring the possibility of using the TypeScript SDK with a new lightweight frontend

## Next Steps
- Continue exploring lightweight JavaScript frameworks for API integration
- Consider building a minimal UI that works directly with MCP endpoints
- Evaluate adding a JavaScript proxy in front of services
- Discuss the feasibility of rebuilding the Go UI with proper dependencies

## Resources
- Original project structure in `/home/mothership/mukka/`
- Existing API endpoints are functional as verified by curl tests
- Model Context Protocol TypeScript SDK may offer alternative integration paths
- JavaScript files we created for the frontend in our previous attempt

## Identified Issues
- The Go-based frontend compilation model prevents simple updates
- API endpoint compatibility issues with alternative UI frameworks
- Increasing complexity when trying to adapt existing solutions
