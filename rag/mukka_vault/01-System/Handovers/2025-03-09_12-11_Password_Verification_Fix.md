# Password Verification Fix for MCP MongoDB Auth Integration

## Issue Summary

The MCP Auth Server was crashing with a segmentation fault during login when using MongoDB as the storage backend. Investigation revealed that the issue was occurring specifically during password verification when calling the `verifyPassword` method on the User model. The crash was happening due to a lack of input validation and error handling in the password verification method.

## Root Cause

1. The `userSchema.methods.verifyPassword` method lacked defensive checking and error handling.
2. When the input password or stored hash wasn't in the expected format, bcrypt would crash with a segmentation fault.
3. The login route didn't have adequate error handling around MongoDB password verification.

## Fix Implementation

1. **Enhanced Password Verification Method**:
   - Added defensive checks for the password hash to ensure it's a valid string
   - Added defensive checks for the input password
   - Added try/catch error handling to prevent crashes
   - Added additional logging for debugging

2. **Fixed Password Setting Method**:
   - Added input validation for the password parameter
   - Added error handling to prevent crashes

3. **Reset Admin Password**:
   - Created a script to reset the admin password in MongoDB
   - Ensured the password hash is in the correct format for bcrypt
   - Verified password verification works correctly with bcrypt

4. **Deployment Approach**:
   - Instead of trying to rebuild the Docker container, we used a direct Node.js process on the host
   - This allowed for easier troubleshooting and debugging of the issue

## Verification

The fix has been deployed and the following tests have been performed:

1. The auth server is running without crashing
2. The admin user can successfully log in with the password "admin123"
3. The MongoDB connection is working correctly
4. The health endpoint reports everything as healthy

## Current Deployment Status

The Auth Server is currently running as a direct Node.js process on the host machine:
- Process ID: 798075
- Command: `node /home/mothership/mukka/backend/services/auth/src/index.js`
- Started by: `/bin/sh -c cd /home/mothership/mukka/backend/services/auth && node run-direct.js`
- Listening on: Port 8097

## Next Steps

1. **Create Docker Container**:
   - Create a new Docker container for the auth server once the fix is confirmed stable
   - Use the updated code with the password verification fixes

2. **Set Up Monitoring**:
   - Monitor the auth server for any additional crashes or issues
   - Implement proper logging and error tracking

3. **Documentation**:
   - Update the deployment documentation to reflect the changes
   - Create a troubleshooting guide for similar issues in the future

## Additional Notes

The password verification issue highlights the importance of proper error handling and input validation in security-critical code. The fix we implemented follows these best practices:

1. Always validate input parameters before passing to critical functions
2. Use try/catch blocks around potentially dangerous operations
3. Add logging to identify issues without revealing sensitive information
4. Add defensive coding practices to handle unexpected inputs

The MongoDB integration is now working correctly with these fixes in place.
