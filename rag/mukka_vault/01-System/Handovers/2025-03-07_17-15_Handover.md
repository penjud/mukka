# Handover - March 7, 2025 (17:15)

## Project Status Summary
- Implemented core MCP server components including base, memory, filesystem, and brave-search services
- Created proper directory structure and server code for each MCP component
- Established service registration system where each MCP service registers with the base server
- Set up Docker containers for the Web UI, Memory, and Filesystem services
- Implemented Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time communication

## Current Implementation Status
- **Base MCP Server**: Implemented with service registry, API ready for use
- **Memory MCP Server**: Implemented with knowledge graph storage capabilities
- **Filesystem MCP Server**: Implemented with file access, browse, and search functionality
- **Brave Search MCP Server**: Implemented API integration with search capabilities
- **MCP Web UI**: Running but not properly connecting to services
- **Ollama Integration**: Not yet implemented

## Current Issues
- Docker containers need to be rebuilt with the new server implementations
- Web UI configuration needs updating to correctly reference MCP services
- Network connectivity needs to be established between containers
- GitHub backup still pending authentication setup

## Next Steps
1. **Rebuild Docker Containers**:
   - Stop existing containers
   - Build and start containers with new implementations
   - Ensure proper networking between containers

2. **Fix Web UI Configuration**:
   - Update `config.yaml` with correct service URLs and ports
   - Configure proper authentication

3. **Set up Ollama Integration**:
   - Implement Ollama bridge service
   - Configure AI models

4. **Complete GitHub Backup**:
   - Set up authentication for GitHub
   - Push repository to backup

## Environment Details
- Server implementations located in:
  - `/home/mothership/mukka/backend/services/base`
  - `/home/mothership/mukka/backend/services/memory`
  - `/home/mothership/mukka/backend/services/filesystem`
  - `/home/mothership/mukka/backend/services/brave-search`
- Docker services running on ports:
  - Base Server: 8090
  - Memory: 8094 (currently running on 8092)
  - Filesystem: 8095 (currently running on 8091)
  - Brave Search: 8096
  - Web UI: 3001

## Notes
The implementation follows the MCP protocol standards with a service-oriented architecture. Each MCP service has its own API endpoints and can communicate with the base server for service discovery. The Web UI can then connect to all available services to provide a unified interface.
