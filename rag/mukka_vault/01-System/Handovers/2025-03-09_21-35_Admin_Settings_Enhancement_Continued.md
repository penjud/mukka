# Admin Settings Enhancement Handover (Continued)

## Overview

This document provides a handover update for the ongoing Admin Settings enhancement work. We've made progress on some issues, but several critical problems remain to be addressed in our next session.

## Current Status

1. **UI Enhancements**
   - ✅ Fixed: The Admin Settings layout and page structure is now properly organized
   - ✅ Fixed: Added required components for User Management, including UserDialog and ConfirmDialog
   - ✅ Fixed: Created SystemConfigForm component with proper validation and error handling

2. **Authentication Flow**
   - ✅ Fixed: Logout function now properly redirects to login page
   - ✅ Enhanced: Added better error handling and timeout management for logout requests
   - ❌ Incomplete: Session persistence still broken when refreshing pages in workspace/agent tabs

3. **User Management**
   - ✅ Added: Complete UI for user creation, editing, and deletion
   - ✅ Modified: API endpoints to target `/admin/users` instead of `/users`
   - ❌ Incomplete: User creation and editing still not functioning properly

4. **System Config**
   - ✅ Added: Fallback logic to try both `/admin/config` and `/config` endpoints
   - ✅ Enhanced: Added better error handling and default configuration
   - ❌ Incomplete: System settings save functionality still not working

5. **Additional Functionality**
   - ❌ Incomplete: User registration flow needs testing
   - ❌ Incomplete: Forgot password functionality needs testing

## Technical Details

### API Integration Issues

We've determined that the API endpoints may not match our current implementation. The Auth Server appears to be rejecting our requests despite targeting what should be the correct endpoints. Our troubleshooting suggests:

1. **For User Management**:
   - Backend might be expecting different request format
   - Admin-specific endpoints may require additional authentication
   - API response format may differ from what frontend expects

2. **For System Config**:
   - Save endpoint may be using a different HTTP method than PUT
   - Configuration format might need adjustment

3. **For Session Persistence**:
   - Token refresh mechanism might be failing silently
   - Route guard may be too aggressive in validating tokens

## Next Steps

### 1. API Endpoint Verification
- Examine the Auth Server's routes and controllers to confirm exact endpoint structure
- Use network monitoring to capture actual request/response data during operations
- Adjust frontend code to match the actual backend API

### 2. Session Persistence Fixes
- Implement a more robust token refresh mechanism
- Add interceptors to detect 401/403 responses and handle authentication issues
- Enhance the router guards to handle page refreshes better

### 3. Testing User Registration & Password Reset
- Verify the complete flow for new user registration
- Test the forgot password functionality including email delivery
- Implement proper error handling for these flows

## Implementation Details

The following files need further modification:

1. **For API Integration**:
   - `/frontend/vue-dashboard/src/services/user-management.js`
   - `/backend/services/auth/src/routes/auth-routes.js` (reference)
   - `/backend/services/auth/src/controllers/user-controller.js` (reference)

2. **For Session Persistence**:
   - `/frontend/vue-dashboard/src/router/index.js`
   - `/frontend/vue-dashboard/src/stores/auth.js`

3. **For Registration & Password Flows**:
   - `/frontend/vue-dashboard/src/views/auth/Register.vue`
   - `/frontend/vue-dashboard/src/views/auth/ForgotPassword.vue`
   - `/frontend/vue-dashboard/src/views/auth/ResetPassword.vue`

This handover provides a roadmap for the next phase of development, focusing on fixing the remaining issues in the Admin Settings interface and authentication flows.
