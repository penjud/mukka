# Project Handover - 2025-03-07 13:15

## Current Status
We've set up the basic Obsidian vault structure for the MCP project at `/home/mothership/mukka/rag/mukka_vault/`. The folder structure includes templates, system documentation, projects, AI conversations, and a new Snippets directory for preserving important information.

## Last Completed Tasks
- Created project folder structure
- Set up Obsidian vault with templates
- Configured directory structure for knowledge organization
- Added template for handover documents
- Created Snippets directory for preserving important information
- Added the Handover Process snippet

## Next Steps
- Create Docker Compose configuration for MCP services (taking into account Docker Desktop is installed)
- Set up Ollama integration
- Configure Memory MCP
- Configure Filesystem MCP
- Configure Brave Search MCP
- Integrate with Obsidian vault

## Context
- The project is located at `/home/mothership/mukka/`
- We're using Docker Compose for containerization
- Authentication will use JWT
- We're integrating Ollama models (llama3.1:8b, dolphin-mistral:7b, NeuralDaredevil-8B)
- Docker Desktop is installed and being used
