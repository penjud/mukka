## Current Status Summary
- Successfully migrated to Vue Dashboard as the primary UI (http://localhost:3002)
- Fixed Docker image reference issues by completely rebuilding the Docker environment
- Configured Nginx in Vue Dashboard to listen on port 80 instead of 3002
- Verified functionality of core features including authentication, agent creation, and chat
- Updated documentation to reflect current deployment status
- Pushed all changes to GitHub repository

## Completed Tasks
- Completely removed all Docker resources (containers, images, volumes) to resolve image hash references
- Rebuilt all Docker images from scratch using `docker-compose build`
- Launched all services with the correct configuration using `docker-compose up -d`
- Fixed Nginx configuration in Vue Dashboard container to listen on the correct port
- Created new agents and tested conversation functionality
- Updated MCP Deployment Checklist to reflect current status
- Created DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md file with key changes
- Pushed all changes to GitHub using SSH authentication

## Technical Issues Resolved
1. **Docker Image Reference Issues**:
   - Resolved by completely cleaning Docker environment and rebuilding all images
   ```bash
   docker system prune -a --volumes -f
   docker-compose build
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **Vue Dashboard Port Configuration**:
   - Fixed Nginx configuration in Vue Dashboard container to listen on port 80 instead of 3002
   ```bash
   docker exec mukka-vue-dashboard sh -c "sed -i 's/listen       3002;/listen       80;/' /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf && nginx -t && nginx -s reload"
   ```

3. **GitHub Push Authentication**:
   - Changed remote URL from HTTPS to SSH to use existing SSH key
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:penjud/mukka.git
   ```

## Remaining Issues
1. **Profile Settings API Error**:
   - Profile settings return 404 error when attempting to update profile
   - Error message: `API Error (404): Cannot PUT /profile/`
   - Likely an endpoint mismatch in Auth Server

2. **UUID Management**:
   - There's a discrepancy between client-generated UUIDs and server-generated UUIDs for agents
   - Currently doesn't impact functionality but should be standardized

## Environment Configuration
- Vue Dashboard: http://localhost:3002 (primary UI)
- Base MCP Server: http://localhost:8090
- Memory MCP Server: http://localhost:8094
- Filesystem MCP Server: http://localhost:8095
- Brave Search MCP Server: http://localhost:8096
- Auth MCP Server: http://localhost:8097
- Ollama Bridge: http://localhost:8082

## Next Steps
1. **Fix Remaining Issues**:
   - Investigate and fix Profile Settings API error
   - Standardize UUID management between client and server
   - Complete testing of Filesystem and Brave Search APIs

2. **Documentation Tasks**:
   - Create system architecture diagram
   - Create comprehensive API documentation for all services
   - Develop user guides for Vue Dashboard

3. **Feature Enhancements**:
   - Implement file browsing UI in Vue Dashboard
   - Implement search interface in Vue Dashboard
   - Develop admin settings interface

The deployment is now stable with Vue Dashboard as the primary UI. Core functionality (authentication, agent creation, conversation) is working correctly. The system is ready for further feature development and testing.
