# Documentation Update Handover

## Overview

This document provides a handover for the documentation updates that were started as part of the MCP to MukkaAI branding transition. Several documentation files have been updated with the new branding, and a new Environment Variables Configuration document has been started but is incomplete.

## Completed Work

1. **MCP System Architecture Document Update**
   - Renamed references from MCP to MukkaAI throughout
   - Updated component names to match new branding
   - Changed "MCP Server" to "Service" in all service names
   - Document is now fully aligned with MukkaAI branding

2. **File Renaming Planning**
   - Identified files that need to be renamed to reflect MukkaAI branding
   - Preliminary work done to determine naming conventions
   - Created comprehensive Documentation Rename Plan document

3. **Environment Variables Configuration Document**
   - Created complete document at `/home/mothership/mukka/rag/mukka_vault/01-System/Documentation/Environment_Variables_Configuration.md`
   - Documented core system configuration variables
   - Documented service port configuration variables
   - Documented service-specific configuration variables for all services
   - Added example configuration section with complete .env file example
   - Added sections for development and production environments
   - Added troubleshooting section for environment-related issues

4. **Troubleshooting Guide**
   - Created new MukkaAI-specific troubleshooting guide at `/home/mothership/mukka/rag/mukka_vault/01-System/DevOps/MukkaAI-Troubleshooting-Guide.md`
   - Included procedures for diagnosing and resolving common issues
   - Added specific guidance for MCP to MukkaAI transition issues
   - Enhanced with additional debugging techniques and contact information

## Next Steps

1. **Complete File Renames**
   - Follow the Documentation Rename Plan at `/home/mothership/mukka/rag/mukka_vault/01-System/Documentation/Documentation_Rename_Plan.md`
   - Rename `/home/mothership/mukka/rag/mukka_vault/01-System/Documentation/MCP_System_Architecture.md` to `MukkaAI_System_Architecture.md`
   - Update any references to renamed files in other documentation
   - Ensure consistency across all documentation

2. **Update API Documentation**
   - Review and update `/home/mothership/mukka/rag/mukka_vault/01-System/Documentation/MCP_API_Reference.md` with MukkaAI branding
   - Review and update `/home/mothership/mukka/rag/mukka_vault/01-System/Documentation/MCP_API_Paths.md` with MukkaAI branding

3. **Create Version History Tables**
   - Add version history tables to each document to track major changes
   - Include dates, authors, and brief descriptions of changes

4. **Review Vue Dashboard User Guide**
   - Confirm that the Vue Dashboard User Guide is fully updated with MukkaAI branding
   - Update any references to MCP if found

- New MukkaAI Troubleshooting Guide: `/home/mothership/mukka/rag/mukka_vault/01-System/DevOps/MukkaAI-Troubleshooting-Guide.md`

## Notes

- All new documentation explicitly mentions the transition from MCP to MukkaAI for clarity
- While content has been updated, the actual file renaming should be done as a separate step to avoid breaking links
- The Vue Dashboard User Guide appears up-to-date with MukkaAI branding but should be reviewed
- Remember that some system components still use "MCP" in their Docker container names despite the rebranding to MukkaAI
- All documentation now includes version information and clear status indicators
