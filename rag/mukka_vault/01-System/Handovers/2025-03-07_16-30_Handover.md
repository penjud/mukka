# Handover - March 7, 2025 (16:30)

## Project Status Summary
- Completed assessment of current MCP setup
- Identified key issues with MCP services communication
- Created comprehensive project checklist
- Docker containers for Web UI (port 3001), Memory (port 8092), and Filesystem (port 8091) are running but not communicating properly

## Current Issues
- MCP Web UI can't discover tools because of configuration issues
- Web UI shows authentication error (401) as expected at this stage
- Multiple docker-compose files with conflicting configurations
- Need proper configuration to enable communication between services

## Next Steps
1. **Fix MCP Services Configuration**:
   - Update web UI configuration to correctly reference memory and filesystem services
   - Ensure proper network connectivity between containers
   - Verify configuration on port 3001 (web UI), 8092 (memory), and 8091 (filesystem)

2. **GitHub Backup**:
   - Complete GitHub authentication setup
   - Push to remote repository

3. **Brave Search Integration**:
   - Add Brave Search capability once core functionality is working
   - Update configuration files for integration

## Environment Details
- Docker services running on ports:
  - Web UI: 3001
  - Filesystem: 8091
  - Memory: 8092
- API keys are configured in .env file
- Project structure established in /home/mothership/mukka/

## Notes
The containers are running but service discovery is failing. The key issue appears to be misconfiguration in how the web UI connects to the memory and filesystem services. The web UI may be searching for MCP services on the wrong ports or hostnames.
