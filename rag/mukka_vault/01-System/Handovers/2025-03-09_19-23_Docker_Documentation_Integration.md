# Docker Documentation Integration Handover

## Overview

This document provides a handover for the Docker integration of the MukkaAI documentation. The rebranded documentation files have been created in the mukka_vault, and the Docker containers have been configured to access these files, ensuring they're available through the Web UI.

## Completed Work

1. **File System Server Docker Integration**
   - Modified docker-compose.yml to add volume mounts for the filesystem service
   - Added `/home/mothership:/home/mothership` volume mount to allow access to mukka_vault
   - Rebuilt the filesystem service container to apply the changes
   - Verified the filesystem service can access the documentation files through the API

2. **Full System Rebuild**
   - Performed a complete rebuild of all services using the rebuild-all.sh script
   - Verified all containers are running correctly after the rebuild
   - Confirmed the Vue Dashboard is accessible at http://localhost:3002

3. **Testing and Validation**
   - Verified API access to documentation files using curl commands
   - Confirmed the filesystem service can list the documentation directory
   - Tested file content retrieval to ensure content is correctly accessible

## Current State

All MukkaAI documentation files are now accessible through the filesystem service API:
- The filesystem service container has access to the host filesystem where mukka_vault is located
- The documentation files can be accessed via http://localhost:8095/ls?directory=/home/mothership/mukka/rag/mukka_vault/01-System/Documentation/
- File content can be retrieved via http://localhost:8095/read?file=/path/to/file

## Next Steps

1. **UI Integration Verification**
   - Verify documentation appears correctly in the Vue Dashboard UI
   - Check for potential browser caching issues
   - Review network requests in the browser console to ensure correct API calls

2. **Permanent Configuration Updates**
   - Update the docker-compose file in version control
   - Document the volume mount requirements for production deployment
   - Include the filesystem configuration in deployment guides

3. **Browser Cache Considerations**
   - Users may need to clear browser cache to see updated documentation
   - Consider adding cache invalidation headers to filesystem service responses
   - Document this requirement for other team members

## Troubleshooting Notes

If documentation files are still not visible in the UI after the Docker integration:

1. **Browser Caching**:
   - Try clearing the browser cache
   - Use incognito/private browsing mode
   - Check network requests to verify API calls

2. **Vue Dashboard Configuration**:
   - Review how the Vue Dashboard is configured to access documentation
   - Check for hardcoded paths in the frontend code
   - Verify the UI is making the correct API calls to the filesystem service

3. **Docker Volume Permissions**:
   - Check file permissions in the host directory
   - Verify the container user has read access to the mukka_vault files
   - Use `docker exec` to explore the filesystem from within the container

## Implementation Details

The Docker integration was implemented by modifying the docker-compose.yml file to add the following volume mount to the filesystem service:

```yaml
services:
  # Filesystem MCP Server
  mcp-filesystem-server:
    # ... existing configuration ...
    volumes:
      - /home/mothership:/home/mothership  # Mount point for accessing mukka_vault
```

This configuration ensures that when the system is deployed, the documentation files in the mukka_vault directory will be accessible to the filesystem service, which can then serve them to the Vue Dashboard UI.
