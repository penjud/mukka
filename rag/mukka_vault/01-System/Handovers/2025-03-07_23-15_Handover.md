## Current Status
- Created new Vue.js-based dashboard for MCP services integration
- Implemented service discovery module with real-time monitoring
- Developed core components structure with working service status display
- Set up unified MCP API interface with proper error handling
- Added placeholder implementations for Memory, Filesystem, Search, and Ollama
- Configured Vite development environment with proxy settings for API endpoints

## Technical Implementation
- Frontend framework: Vue 3 with Composition API
- Vue Router for navigation between service interfaces
- Real-time service status monitoring with periodic health checks
- SSE (Server-Sent Events) support for streaming data from MCP services
- Configurable endpoint management via central configuration file
- Responsive design compatible with various screen sizes

## Component Status
- [x] **ServiceStatus**: Fully implemented with real-time monitoring
- [x] **MemoryManager**: Basic implementation with CRUD operations
- [x] **FilesystemExplorer**: Placeholder implementation
- [x] **SearchInterface**: Placeholder implementation
- [x] **OllamaInterface**: Placeholder implementation with chat UI

## Service Implementation
- [x] **Discovery Service**: Working implementation for service health checking
- [x] **MCP API Service**: Unified API interface with proper error handling
- [ ] **Authentication Service**: Not yet implemented

## Next Steps
1. Connect MemoryManager to actual Memory MCP service API
2. Implement file browsing capabilities in FilesystemExplorer
3. Integrate Brave Search API in SearchInterface
4. Set up Ollama Bridge connection for AI chat functionality
5. Add automated testing for components and services
6. Configure production build and deployment process

## GitHub Backup
- Created backup script in `/home/mothership/mukka/frontend/vue-dashboard/backup-to-github.sh`
- Repository structure is ready for pushing to GitHub
- Regular backups scheduled via monitoring script

## Resources
- Project directory: `/home/mothership/mukka/frontend/vue-dashboard/`
- MCP service configuration: `/home/mothership/mukka/frontend/vue-dashboard/src/config/mcp-endpoints.js`
- Implementation status document: `/home/mothership/mukka/frontend/vue-dashboard/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`
- Service monitoring script: `/home/mothership/mukka/frontend/vue-dashboard/service-check.js`

## Known Issues
- Service discovery currently simulates services without actual connection
- API endpoints need configuration based on actual MCP service implementation
- UI components need to be connected to real services once available
