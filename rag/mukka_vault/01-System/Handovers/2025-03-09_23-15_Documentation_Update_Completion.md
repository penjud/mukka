## Status and Notes

All documentation has been created and is now ready for use. The original MCP files still exist in the filesystem and will need to be removed once the team confirms the new documentation is satisfactory.

A few important notes:

1. **Container Naming**: All documentation notes that container names still use the "MCP" prefix despite the rebranding to MukkaAI.

2. **Version History**: All new documents include version history tables for tracking changes.

3. **References**: Cross-references between documents have been updated to point to the new MukkaAI-branded files.

4. **Branding Notes**: All documents include notes about the transition from MCP to MukkaAI for clarity.

## Recommendations for Next Steps

1. **Review and Validate**: Have team members review the updated documentation for accuracy and completeness.

2. **Remove Original Files**: Once the team approves the new documentation, remove the original MCP files to avoid confusion.

3. **Update Vue Dashboard**: Ensure the Vue Dashboard UI is fully updated with MukkaAI branding.

4. **Container Renaming**: Consider renaming Docker containers to match the MukkaAI branding in a future update.

5. **Knowledge Graph**: Update the knowledge graph with information about the new MukkaAI system and documentation.
