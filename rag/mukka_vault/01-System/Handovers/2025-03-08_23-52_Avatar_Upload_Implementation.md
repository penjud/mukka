## Overview

This handover documents the implementation of avatar upload functionality in the Agent Management module. Previously, agent avatars were using placeholders without actual file upload capabilities. A fully functional file upload system has been implemented, allowing users to personalize agents with custom avatars.

## Background

The Agent Management page had mock/placeholder avatar functionalities that displayed `/avatars/placeholder.jpg` instead of actually uploading and using custom images. This was identified during testing when the debug logs showed: "Avatar file provided, would upload in production" followed by using a placeholder path.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Filesystem Server Enhancements

The following improvements were made to the filesystem server to handle file uploads:

- Added multer middleware for multipart form data processing
- Created dedicated upload directories for avatars
- Implemented proper file naming with timestamps to avoid collisions
- Added MIME type verification for security
- Created RESTful endpoints for file uploads and retrieval

```javascript
// Configure multer for file uploads
const storage = multer.diskStorage({
  destination: (req, file, cb) => {
    if (req.path.includes('/avatar')) {
      cb(null, AVATARS_DIR);
    } else {
      cb(null, UPLOADS_DIR);
    }
  },
  filename: (req, file, cb) => {
    const extension = path.extname(file.originalname) || '.jpg';
    const filename = `${Date.now()}-${Math.round(Math.random() * 1E9)}${extension}`;
    cb(null, filename);
  }
});
```

### 2. New File Upload Endpoint

A dedicated endpoint was added to the filesystem server:

```javascript
// File upload endpoint for avatars
app.post('/uploads/avatar', upload.single('avatar'), async (req, res) => {
  try {
    if (!req.file) {
      return res.status(400).json({ error: 'No file uploaded' });
    }
    
    // Create a publicly accessible URL
    const relativePath = path.relative(UPLOADS_DIR, req.file.path);
    const filePath = `/uploads/${relativePath}`;
    
    // Return the file info with URL path
    res.json({
      success: true,
      originalName: req.file.originalname,
      filename: req.file.filename,
      filePath,
      url: filePath,
      size: req.file.size,
      mimetype: req.file.mimetype
    });
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error('Error uploading avatar:', error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: error.message });
  }
});
```

### 3. Frontend Integration

The Agent Management component was updated to properly handle file uploads:

- Enhanced form submission to use FormData for multipart uploads
- Added service discovery checks to ensure the filesystem service is available
- Implemented proper error handling with fallback to placeholders
- Improved debug logging to track upload process

```javascript
// Handle avatar upload if provided
if (avatarFile.value) {
  debugInfo.value.push('Avatar file provided, uploading it now');
  try {
    // Create a FormData object for the file upload
    const formData = new FormData();
    formData.append('avatar', avatarFile.value);
    
    // Get filesystem service endpoint
    const filesystemService = serviceStore.services['filesystem'];
    if (!filesystemService || !filesystemService.status) {
      throw new Error('Filesystem service not available');
    }
    
    // Upload the file to the filesystem MCP service
    const uploadUrl = filesystemService.endpoint + '/uploads/avatar';
    const uploadResponse = await fetch(uploadUrl, {
      method: 'POST',
      body: formData
    });
    
    if (!uploadResponse.ok) {
      throw new Error(`Upload failed: ${uploadResponse.statusText}`);
    }
    
    const uploadResult = await uploadResponse.json();
    
    // Set the avatar path to the uploaded file URL
    const avatarUrl = filesystemService.endpoint + uploadResult.filePath;
    agentFormData.avatar = avatarUrl;
  } catch (uploadError) {
    // Fall back to placeholder only if upload fails
    agentFormData.avatar = '/avatars/agent-' + Date.now() + '.jpg';
  }
}
```

### 4. Package Dependencies

Added the multer package to the filesystem server for handling multipart form data:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "express": "^4.18.2",
  "cors": "^2.8.5",
  "body-parser": "^1.20.2",
  "winston": "^3.10.0",
  "dotenv": "^16.3.1",
  "fs-extra": "^11.1.1",
  "chokidar": "^3.5.3",
  "axios": "^1.4.0",
  "mime-types": "^2.1.35",
  "glob": "^10.3.3",
  "multer": "^1.4.5-lts.1"
}
```

## Files Modified

1. `/home/mothership/mukka/backend/services/filesystem/src/index.js`:
   - Added multer middleware configuration
   - Implemented file upload endpoints
   - Created static file serving for uploaded files

2. `/home/mothership/mukka/backend/services/filesystem/package.json`:
   - Added multer dependency for multipart form data handling

3. `/home/mothership/mukka/frontend/vue-dashboard/src/views/agents/AgentManagement.vue`:
   - Updated avatar upload logic to use the filesystem service
   - Enhanced error handling and logging
   - Improved user experience with proper feedback

## Integration with Docker Environment

The implementation needed careful consideration of the Docker environment:

1. Created a rebuild script to properly rebuild the filesystem server with the new dependencies:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   set -e

   echo "Building Filesystem MCP Server from source..."
   BUILD_DIR=$(mktemp -d)
   cp -r /home/mothership/mukka/backend/services/filesystem/* $BUILD_DIR/
   cd $BUILD_DIR
   docker build -t mukka/mcp-filesystem-server:latest .
   docker stop mukka-mcp-filesystem-server || true
   docker rm mukka-mcp-filesystem-server || true
   docker run -d \
     --name mukka-mcp-filesystem-server \
     --network mukka_mukka-network \
     -v /home/mothership:/home/mothership:rw \
     -p 8095:8095 \
     mukka/mcp-filesystem-server:latest
   ```

2. Maintained compatibility with the existing Docker network structure and service discovery mechanisms

## Challenges Encountered

1. **Vue Dashboard Container Issues**:
   - When rebuilding the filesystem service, the Vue Dashboard container became inaccessible
   - Root cause was the Vue Dashboard container running outside the main Docker Compose stack
   - Fixed by using the proper start script (`start-vue-dashboard.sh`) to reintegrate it into the stack

2. **Docker Configuration Complexity**:
   - The project uses two different Docker Compose configurations which caused confusion
   - Main file: `/home/mothership/mukka/docker-compose.yml`
   - Secondary file: `/home/mothership/mukka/mcp-docker/docker-compose.yml`
   - Ensured all changes were made to the correct configuration

## Testing Performed

- Verified image uploads work correctly in the Agent Management interface
- Confirmed uploaded images are properly stored and served
- Tested error handling with various invalid file types
- Verified fallback to placeholder images when uploads fail

## Future Considerations

1. **Upload Enhancements**:
   - Add file size validation and better error messaging
   - Implement image cropping/resizing for consistency
   - Consider adding image format conversion for compatibility

2. **Security Improvements**:
   - Add content validation for uploaded files
   - Implement proper authentication for upload endpoints
   - Consider adding virus scanning for production environments

3. **User Experience**:
   - Add preview functionality before confirming uploads
   - Implement progress indicators for large files
   - Add drag-and-drop support for easier uploading
