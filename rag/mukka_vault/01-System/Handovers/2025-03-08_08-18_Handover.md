## Current Status
- Fixed Vue Dashboard authentication issues with Auth Server
- Corrected Docker network configuration for proper container communication
- Resolved bcrypt password comparison issue in Auth Server
- Enhanced Auth Server with better error logging and debugging endpoints
- Added CORS support for Vue Dashboard on port 3002
- Implemented improved health check endpoint for service discovery
- Successfully tested login functionality with admin credentials

## Technical Implementation
- **Network Configuration**:
  - Identified the correct Docker network as `mukka_mukka-network` (not `mukka-network`)
  - Updated container deployment commands to use the correct network
  - Verified proper network connectivity between Vue Dashboard and Auth Server

- **Auth Server Enhancements**:
  - Fixed user creation logic to prevent password hash issues
  - Added comprehensive request/response logging
  - Implemented debugging endpoints for troubleshooting
  - Added health check endpoint for service discovery
  - Fixed CORS configuration to allow requests from Vue Dashboard (port 3002)
  - Modified login endpoint to include token in response body and cookie

- **Vue Dashboard Updates**:
  - Updated endpoint configuration to match actual server paths
  - Modified authentication store to handle both cookie and token-based auth
  - Changed discovery endpoint to use new health check endpoint
  - Updated registration and password recovery components to match current Auth Server capabilities

## Deployment Status
- All MCP services are running:
  - Base Server (8090)
  - Memory Server (8094)
  - Filesystem Server (8095)
  - Brave Search Server (8096)
  - Auth Server (8097)
  - Ollama Bridge (8082)
  - Web UI (3001)
  - Vue Dashboard (3002)
  
- Authentication is working with the following credentials:
  - Username: `admin`
  - Password: `admin123`

## Next Steps
1. Implement Personal Workspace features:
   - Chat interface with conversation history
   - Previous conversations sidebar
   - Model selection dropdown

2. Develop Agent Management features:
   - Agent creation/editing interface
   - Persona traits configuration
   - System prompt editor

3. Integrate with Memory MCP for conversation storage:
   - Extend schema to support agent profiles
   - Associate conversations with specific agents

4. Update documentation:
   - Create architecture diagram
   - Complete user guides for each service

## Infrastructure Status
- Docker containers are running in correct network configuration
- All API endpoints are accessible with proper CORS settings
- Authentication is working through HTTP-only cookies and JWT tokens
- Environment variables have been configured for proper service discovery

## Known Issues
- Registration page is limited to admin-only user creation (by design)
- Password recovery functionality is a placeholder (not fully implemented)
- Some services use inconsistent API path patterns (/api prefix vs root paths)
- Service discovery currently relies on different health check endpoints

## Resources
- API endpoint documentation: `/home/mothership/mukka/rag/mukka_vault/01-System/Documentation/MCP_API_Paths.md`
- Deployment checklist: `/home/mothership/mukka/rag/mukka_vault/01-System/Project Status/MCP_Deployment_Checklist.md`
- Vue Dashboard code: `/home/mothership/mukka/frontend/vue-dashboard`
- Auth Server code: `/home/mothership/mukka/backend/services/auth`

## Troubleshooting Tips
- If experiencing network connectivity issues between containers, verify they are on the same Docker network (`mukka_mukka-network`)
- For authentication problems, check Auth Server logs with `docker logs mukka-mcp-auth-server`
- Use the debug endpoint `http://localhost:8097/debug/users` to verify user data (development only)
- After modifying Auth Server code, rebuild with `docker build -t mukka_mcp-auth-server .` and restart the container
- For Vue Dashboard changes, rebuild with `docker build -t mukka_vue-dashboard .` and restart the container
