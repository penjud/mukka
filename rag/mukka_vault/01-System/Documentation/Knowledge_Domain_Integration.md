# Knowledge Domain Integration Implementation

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the MukkaAI Knowledge Domain Integration system (Phase 3 of the Agent System Implementation Checklist). The knowledge domain system enables agents to access domain-specific knowledge from the mukka_vault, with specialized retrieval algorithms, indexing strategies, and citation capabilities.

## Implemented Components

### 1. Knowledge Domain Taxonomy
- Created a hierarchical taxonomy of knowledge domains with:
  - Five top-level domains: Legal, Medical, Technical, Business, and Education
  - Fifteen subdomains across these top-level domains
  - Domain-specific key terms and metadata
  - Mapping to mukka_vault paths for content organization

### 2. Resource Metadata Schema
- Implemented a comprehensive metadata schema for knowledge resources:
  - Basic information (title, description, domain/subdomain IDs)
  - Content categorization (tags, key terms)
  - Source quality ratings and confidence scores
  - Citation formatting requirements
  - Retrieval strategy preferences

### 3. Domain-Specific Retrieval System
- Developed a specialized retrieval system with:
  - Semantic search using embeddings
  - Keyword-based search for exact matches
  - Hybrid approach combining both techniques
  - Domain-specific relevance scoring
  - Multi-step retrieval pipeline
  - Confidence scoring for results

### 4. Content Indexing System
- Implemented an indexing service that:
  - Processes markdown files in the mukka_vault
  - Extracts frontmatter metadata
  - Creates text chunks for long documents
  - Generates embeddings for semantic search
  - Supports both full and incremental indexing
  - Creates directory structure based on domain taxonomy

### 5. Citation System
- Created a citation service that:
  - Formats citations in multiple styles (inline, footnotes, bibliography)
  - Includes confidence scores for transparency
  - Supports APA and MLA citation formats
  - Provides citation templates for different content types
  - Generates citation blocks for agent responses

## Technical Implementation

```

### API Endpoints

The knowledge domain system exposes the following API endpoints through the Filesystem MCP server:

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/knowledge/domains` | GET | Get the full domain taxonomy |
| `/knowledge/domains/:domainId` | GET | Get a specific domain's information |
| `/knowledge/retrieve` | POST | Retrieve knowledge based on query and domain |
| `/knowledge/index` | POST | Start a full indexing process |
| `/knowledge/index/update` | POST | Update specific files in the index |
| `/knowledge/index/status` | GET | Get the status of the indexing process |
| `/knowledge/schema` | GET | Get the metadata schema for domain resources |

### Mukka Vault Structure

The knowledge domain content is organized in the mukka_vault using the following structure:

```
/home/mothership/mukka/rag/mukka_vault/
└── 05-Domains/
    ├── Legal/
    │   ├── overview.md
    │   ├── Contracts/
    │   ├── IntellectualProperty/
    │   └── Compliance/
    │       └── gdpr-compliance-guide.md
    ├── Medical/
    │   ├── overview.md
    │   ├── General/
    │   ├── Conditions/
    │   └── Wellness/
    ├── Technical/
    │   ├── overview.md
    │   ├── Programming/
    │   │   └── javascript-best-practices.md
    │   ├── Infrastructure/
    │   └── DataScience/
    ├── Business/
    │   ├── overview.md
    │   ├── Management/
    │   ├── Finance/
    │   └── Marketing/
    └── Education/
        ├── overview.md
        ├── Teaching/
        ├── Learning/
        └── Resources/
```

## Integration with Agent System

The knowledge domain system integrates with the agent system in the following ways:

1. **Agent Creation**: Agents can be assigned specific knowledge domains during creation
2. **Prompt Engineering**: The agent's system prompt can include domain-specific context
3. **RAG Integration**: Relevant domain knowledge is retrieved during conversation
4. **Citation**: Agents can cite sources from the knowledge domain in their responses
5. **Feedback Loop**: Domain relevance can be improved based on agent interactions

## Testing Instructions

1. **Setup Domain Structure**:
   ```bash
   cd /home/mothership/mukka/backend
   node scripts/setup-domain-structure.js
   ```

2. **Index Content**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8091/knowledge/index
   ```

3. **Test Retrieval**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8091/knowledge/retrieve \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "query": "What are JavaScript best practices?",
       "domainId": "technical",
       "retrievalStrategy": "hybrid",
       "maxResults": 5
     }'
   ```

## Known Limitations

1. The current embedding implementation uses mock embeddings for development
2. Full-text search is performed using simple keyword matching rather than a specialized search engine
3. The indexing process is synchronous and may be slow for large knowledge bases
4. The implementation does not yet support versioning of knowledge content
5. There is no automatic monitoring of knowledge quality and relevance

## Next Steps

1. **Agent Template System (Phase 4)**
   - Create high-quality agent templates that leverage domain knowledge
   - Implement template browsing and selection UI
   - Create template versioning system
   - Build template testing framework

2. **Improve Knowledge Retrieval**
   - Implement a production-ready embedding service
   - Add support for more advanced query types
   - Implement a specialized search engine for full-text search
   - Create automated relevance testing

3. **Enhance Content Management**
   - Develop a knowledge content contribution workflow
   - Implement content quality validation
   - Add support for version control of knowledge content
   - Create a feedback mechanism for agent-knowledge interactions

## Notes

The knowledge domain integration provides a solid foundation for domain-specific agent capabilities. The system allows agents to access relevant knowledge based on user queries, with appropriate citations and confidence scoring.

While the initial implementation is focused on text-based knowledge, future iterations could include support for other media types, structured data, and more complex knowledge representations.
