# MukkaAI Agent Architecture

## Overview

This document defines the architecture and design principles for MukkaAI's agent system. Agents are AI assistants with specific personalities, expertise domains, and access to different capabilities through MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers. Each agent interacts with users through a dedicated LLM model and can access various resources and tools based on its configuration.

## Agent Components

### 1. Core Components

- **Dedicated LLM**: Each agent is powered by a specific LLM model (e.g., llama3, dolphin-mistral, NeuralDaredevil). Users can change this when creating custom agents.
- **Personality Profile**: Defines how the agent communicates, including tone, speech patterns, and interaction style.
- **Knowledge Domain**: Areas of expertise the agent specializes in (e.g., Law, Medicine, Engineering).
- **Memory Systems**:
  - **Short-term Memory**: Recent conversation history (handled by Memory MCP)
  - **Long-term Memory**: Persistent knowledge in mukka_vault (RAG system)

### 2. MCP Integration

Agents access extended capabilities through MCP servers:

- **Memory MCP**: Stores conversation history and agent profiles
- **Filesystem MCP**: Provides access to files and documents
- **Brave Search MCP**: Enables web search capabilities
- **Auth MCP**: Manages authentication and permissions
- **Ollama Bridge**: Connects to LLM models for inference

## Personality System

The agent's personality defines how it engages with users beyond its knowledge domain. This creates a unique user experience tailored to different preferences.

### Personality Traits

Personality traits influence how agents:
- Respond to queries (direct vs. conversational)
- Express emotions and reactions
- Use language (formal vs. casual, technical vs. simple)
- Handle interruptions and changes in conversation flow
- Apply humor, sarcasm, or other speech characteristics

### Personality Implementation

Each personality trait is defined through:

1. **Base Prompt**: Core instructions that shape the agent's responses
2. **Examples**: Sample interactions demonstrating the personality
3. **Parameter Settings**: LLM configuration parameters that influence response style
4. **RAG Context**: Relevant personality descriptors stored in mukka_vault

### Example Personality: "Bogan"

A "bogan" personality trait examples:
- Shows frustration when interrupted
- Uses casual, sometimes crude language
- Requires encouragement to engage fully
- Demonstrates exceptional capability once engaged
- May use slang or colloquialisms

## Knowledge and Expertise

Agents gain domain expertise through:

1. **RAG System Integration**: Direct access to knowledge artifacts in mukka_vault related to their domain
2. **Domain-Specific Prompting**: Base instructions that frame the agent as an expert in its field
3. **Tool Access**: Specialized tools or APIs relevant to the domain

### RAG Integration Strategy

The mukka_vault serves as the agent's persistent memory and knowledge base. For domain expertise:

1. Organize documentation by domain in the mukka_vault
2. Create domain-specific indexes for efficient retrieval
3. Link personality traits with relevant knowledge areas
4. Implement source citation capabilities to reference mukka_vault documents

## Agent Creation and Customization

### Agent Templates

Pre-configured agents with specific personalities and knowledge domains, including:
- Professional specialists (Legal, Medical, Engineering)
- Creative assistants (Writing, Design, Brainstorming)
- Technical experts (Programming, Data Analysis)
- Personality-focused assistants (Friendly, Direct, Humorous)

### User Customization

Users can:
- Select from existing templates
- Modify personality traits
- Choose preferred LLM models
- Define knowledge domains
- Configure tool access permissions

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Agent Framework
- Define agent data model and storage schema
- Implement basic personality trait system
- Set up LLM model selection framework
- Create integration with Memory MCP

### Phase 2: Personality Development
- Develop personality trait configurations
- Create examples for each trait
- Design parameter optimization for different personalities
- Implement personality selection UI

### Phase 3: Knowledge Integration
- Organize mukka_vault by knowledge domains
- Create domain-specific RAG indexes
- Implement domain-based retrieval mechanisms
- Develop source citation system

### Phase 4: User Customization
- Build agent customization interface
- Create template selection system
- Implement user agent management
- Add personality testing capabilities

## Next Steps

1. **Personality Trait Framework**:
   - Define core personality traits available in the system
   - Create structured definitions for each trait
   - Develop prompt templates that implement these traits
   - Design a testing methodology for personality validation

2. **Knowledge Domain Management**:
   - Establish knowledge domain taxonomy
   - Organize existing mukka_vault content by domain
   - Develop domain-specific RAG retrieval strategies
   - Create tools for measuring and improving domain expertise

3. **LLM Model Integration**:
   - Evaluate different LLM models for personality compatibility
   - Optimize model parameters for different personality types
   - Test model switching capabilities
   - Measure performance across different agents

4. **User Interaction Design**:
   - Design the agent selection and customization interface
   - Create personality trait demos for users
   - Develop feedback mechanisms for agent performance
   - Implement agent comparison tools
