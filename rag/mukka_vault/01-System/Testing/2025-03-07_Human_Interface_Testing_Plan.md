# MCP Human Interface Testing Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for testing the human interface (Web UI) integration with the fixed backend services. The Web UI is accessible at http://localhost:3001.

## Testing Environment
- Web UI: http://localhost:3001
- Browser: Chrome/Firefox (latest version)
- Test User: admin/admin123

## Test Cases

### 1. Initial UI Verification
- [ ] Login to the Web UI
- [ ] Verify the UI loads without errors
- [ ] Verify all navigation elements are present
- [ ] Confirm no UI changes were required after backend fixes

### 2. Conversation History (Memory MCP)
- [ ] Create a new conversation
- [ ] Send messages in the conversation
- [ ] Verify messages are displayed correctly
- [ ] Close and reopen the conversation to verify messages are retrieved
- [ ] Create multiple conversations and switch between them

### 3. File Browsing (Filesystem MCP)
- [ ] Navigate to the file browser section
- [ ] Browse through different directories
- [ ] View file contents
- [ ] Verify file content is displayed correctly
- [ ] Test navigation between directories

### 4. Web Search (Brave Search MCP)
- [ ] Perform a web search query
- [ ] Verify search results are displayed
- [ ] Click on search results and verify they open
- [ ] Test different search queries and filters

### 5. Model Switching (Ollama Bridge)
- [ ] View available models
- [ ] Switch between different models
- [ ] Send a chat message to the selected model
- [ ] Verify response is received from the model
- [ ] Test different models and compare responses

## Testing Procedure
1. For each test case, document:
   - Test date and time
   - Test executor
   - Expected result
   - Actual result
   - Screenshots if applicable
   - Pass/Fail status

2. For any failures:
   - Document the exact steps to reproduce
   - Capture error messages or screenshots
   - Note browser console errors
   - Analyze whether the issue is in the UI or backend

## Test Results Summary
Record pass/fail results for each major component:

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Initial UI | Partially tested | UI is accessible at http://localhost:3001 and loads without errors |
| Conversation History | Not tested | |
| File Browsing | Not tested | |
| Web Search | Not tested | |
| Model Switching | Not tested | |

## Next Steps After Testing
1. Document any UI issues found
2. Prioritize issues based on severity
3. Create a plan to address high-priority issues
4. Update the MCP Deployment Checklist with test results

## Notes
- The test cases focus on integration points between the UI and the fixed backend services
- Priority should be given to verifying the functionality fixed in the backend
