# MCP Project Implementation Summary

## Overview
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) project provides a modular architecture for AI model interaction and context management. The system consists of several microservices that handle different aspects of AI context management, including memory, filesystem access, web search, and model execution.

## Key Components

### MCP Core Services
- **Base MCP Server**: Central service registry and communication hub
- **Memory MCP**: Knowledge graph and conversation history storage
- **Filesystem MCP**: Access to file system and Obsidian vault
- **Brave Search MCP**: Web search capabilities
- **Auth MCP**: Authentication and user management

### AI Integration
- **Ollama Server**: Local AI model execution
- **Ollama Bridge**: MCP-compatible interface for model management and execution

### Frontend
- **MCP Web UI**: React-based user interface for interacting with all MCP services

## Implementation Status
- Memory MCP and Filesystem MCP are operational
- Web UI is running and can connect to existing services
- Ollama Bridge implementation completed
- Conversation history functionality added to Memory MCP

## Technical Architecture
- Containerized microservices using Docker
- RESTful APIs with JSON communication
- JWT-based authentication
- Socket.IO for real-time updates
- Persistent storage using JSON files

## Deployment
A deployment script (`deploy.sh`) is available to build and run individual or all components.

## Next Steps
1. Deploy remaining services (Base, Brave Search, Auth, Ollama, Ollama Bridge)
2. Test model switching through Ollama Bridge
3. Test conversation history in Memory MCP
4. Complete documentation and monitoring
