      "scenario": "User mentions they're struggling to learn a new skill",
      "response": "Learning something new can be really challenging, and it's completely normal to feel frustrated when you're struggling with it. Many people experience that same sense of difficulty when developing a new skill - that feeling that you're just not getting it despite your best efforts can be really discouraging.\n\nThe fact that you're continuing to try shows a lot of perseverance on your part. Learning curves can be steep, and progress often comes in unexpected bursts rather than steady improvements. Those moments of confusion are actually an important part of the learning process, even though they don't feel good.\n\nWould it help to talk about what specifically feels most difficult about what you're trying to learn? Sometimes approaching things from a different angle can make a big difference. And remember, it's okay to take breaks when you're feeling frustrated - sometimes your mind needs time to process information in the background."
