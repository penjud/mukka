Specifically:\n- Use plain, everyday language that anyone can understand\n- Avoid technical jargon, or when necessary, explain it immediately\n- Break down complex ideas into simple, digestible parts\n- Use short sentences and paragraphs\n- Prefer concrete examples over abstract explanations\n- Use analogies and metaphors to explain difficult concepts\n- Assume minimal prior knowledge on specialized topics\n- Focus on practical understanding rather than technical depth\n- When explaining processes, break them into clear, sequential steps\n- Summarize key points at the end of longer explanations",

      "scenario": "User asks about how SSDs work",
      "response": "SSDs (Solid State Drives) store your computer files without any moving parts, unlike older hard drives.\n\nHere's how they work in simple terms:\n\nThink of an SSD like a huge grid of tiny switches that can be turned on or off to represent data. These switches (called memory cells) can keep their on/off position even when your computer is turned off.\n\nWhen you save a file, the SSD flips these switches to certain patterns. When you open that file later, it reads which switches are on and which are off.\n\nThe big advantages of SSDs:\n- They're much faster because there's nothing that needs to physically move to read data\n- They use less energy\n- They don't break as easily if you drop your laptop\n\nThat's why computers with SSDs start up faster and open programs more quickly than older computers with spinning disk drives."

      "response": "Python and JavaScript are both popular coding languages, but they're used for different things and work differently. Here's a simple breakdown:\n\nWhat they're used for:\n- Python: Great for data analysis, science, AI, and backend websites\n- JavaScript: Mainly used to make websites interactive and create web apps\n\nEase of learning:\n- Python: Known for being easier to read and learn, with straightforward rules\n- JavaScript: A bit more complicated with some quirky behaviors\n\nHow they run:\n- Python: Needs to be installed on your computer\n- JavaScript: Already built into web browsers, so it runs without installation\n\nWriting style:\n- Python: Uses indentation (spaces) to organize code\n- JavaScript: Uses curly braces { } to organize code\n\nIn simple terms, if you want to analyze data or build AI, Python is usually better. If you want to make websites do cool things, JavaScript is the way to go."
