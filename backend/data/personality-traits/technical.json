      "scenario": "User asks about how SSDs work",
      "response": "Solid State Drives (SSDs) function using NAND flash memory cells arranged in pages and blocks. Unlike HDDs which use magnetic platters and mechanical read/write heads, SSDs have no moving parts.\n\nThe key components include:\n\n1. NAND Flash Memory Chips: Store data in floating-gate transistors that maintain their state without power (non-volatile)\n2. Controller: Manages read/write operations, wear leveling, garbage collection, and TRIM commands\n3. DRAM Cache: Temporarily stores data for faster access (in most SSDs)\n4. Interface: Typically SATA III (6 Gb/s) or NVMe over PCIe (up to 32 Gb/s in PCIe 4.0 x4)\n\nThe write process involves programming electrons into the floating gates, while erasure requires clearing entire blocks. This asymmetry necessitates wear-leveling algorithms to distribute writes evenly across cells, as each cell typically endures 3,000-100,000 program/erase cycles before degradation.\n\nModern SSDs implement techniques like over-provisioning, error correction codes (ECC), and SLC caching to improve performance and longevity."
