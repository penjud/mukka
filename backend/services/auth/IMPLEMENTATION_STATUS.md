3. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Added .env and .env.example files for configuration
   - Added MongoDB connection string and pool size settings
   - Documented all environment variables

## Deployment Requirements

### MongoDB Setup

To take full advantage of the MongoDB integration, a MongoDB server needs to be properly configured. Without these steps, the system will automatically fall back to file-based storage:

1. **Install MongoDB**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install -y mongodb
   ```

2. **Start and Enable MongoDB Service**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start mongodb
   sudo systemctl enable mongodb
   ```

3. **Verify MongoDB is Running**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status mongodb
   mongo --eval 'db.runCommand({ connectionStatus: 1 })'
   ```

4. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   - `USE_MONGODB=true` - Set to enable MongoDB integration
   - `MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/mcp-auth` - Connection URI
   - `MONGODB_CONNECTION_POOL_SIZE=10` - Connection pool size (optional)

5. **Run the Migration Script** (to transfer existing users):
   ```bash
   npm run migrate
   ```

6. **Security Considerations**:
   - For production, use authentication and TLS/SSL
   - Restrict network access to the MongoDB server
   - Use a dedicated user with appropriate permissions
   - Regularly backup the database

4. **Monitoring**:
   - Set up monitoring for the MongoDB instance
   - Regularly check the health endpoint (/health) for database status

# Authentication System Implementation Status

## Overview

This document provides the current status of the authentication system implementation based on the handover document and subsequent improvements.

## Completed Tasks

### Authentication System Enhancements
- ✅ Created secure storage service for frontend token storage
- ✅ Added password strength indicator component
- ✅ Enhanced login/reset password forms with proper loading states and transitions
- ✅ Created foundation for MongoDB integration (models, repositories, connection)
- ✅ Created migration script for moving from file-based to database storage
- ✅ Added feature flags for controlling storage backend
- ✅ Created detailed database integration plan

### Frontend (Vue Dashboard)
- ✅ Implemented secure-ls for encrypted local storage
- ✅ Added proper loading states and transitions
- ✅ Implemented password strength indicator
- ✅ Enhanced input validation with better feedback

### Backend (Auth Server)
- ✅ Created MongoDB database models (User, RefreshToken, PasswordResetToken)
- ✅ Created repository layer for data access
- ✅ Set up database connection with proper error handling
- ✅ Created migration script for data transfer
- ✅ Added feature flags for controlling storage backend

## Remaining Tasks

### Backend (Auth Server)
- ✅ Update main index.js to implement MongoDB integration
- ✅ Add health check endpoints for database connection
- ⬜ Create automated tests for database repositories
- ⬜ Update API documentation to reflect database changes

### Frontend (Vue Dashboard)
- ⬜ Test authentication flow with updated components
- ⬜ Add toast notifications for auth events
- ⬜ Create automated tests for auth flows

### Integration Points
- ⬜ Test authentication flow with all services
- ⬜ Ensure proper token verification in all protected API endpoints
- ⬜ Fix Auth Server port number inconsistencies in documentation
- ⬜ Test error scenarios (auth server down, expired tokens, etc.)

## Implementation Notes

The MongoDB integration has been implemented with compatibility in mind. The system can run with either file-based storage or MongoDB depending on the feature flags. This allows for a smooth transition with the ability to fall back to the file-based system if needed. Key features include:

1. **Seamless Fallback Mechanism**: If MongoDB is unavailable or encounters errors, the system automatically falls back to file-based storage, ensuring continuous operation.

2. **Enhanced Health Monitoring**: A new health check endpoint provides detailed information about the database connection status.

3. **Feature Flag Control**: MongoDB usage can be toggled on/off through environment variables without code changes.

4. **Graceful Error Handling**: All database operations include proper error handling with appropriate logging.

### Data Migration

A comprehensive migration script has been created to transfer users, refresh tokens, and password reset tokens from the JSON file to MongoDB. The script includes:

- Validation of existing data
- Error handling for duplicate entries
- Logging of migration progress
- Proper conversion of dates and types

### Security Improvements

1. **Frontend token storage**:
   - Implemented secure-ls for encrypted local storage of tokens
   - Added fallback mechanism for environments where secure storage is not available

2. **Password strength indicator**:
   - Added visual feedback on password complexity
   - Implemented scoring system based on length and character types

### MongoDB Security Improvements

The MongoDB integration includes several security enhancements:

1. **Proper Schema Validation**: MongoDB schemas enforce data integrity and prevent malformed data.

2. **Indexes for Performance and Security**: Strategic indexes have been added for fast lookups and to prevent duplicate entries.

3. **Token Revocation and Cleanup**: Improved methods for token management, including automatic cleanup of expired tokens.

4. **Automatic Recovery**: The system can recover from temporary database outages without manual intervention.

5. **Connection Pooling**: Optimized database connections for better performance under load.

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Complete the implementation of the MongoDB integration in the main application code
2. Test the authentication flow with both storage backends
   - Test user login/logout with MongoDB
   - Test token refresh with MongoDB
   - Test fallback mechanism when MongoDB is unavailable
3. Deploy to staging for further testing
   - Monitor resource usage and performance metrics
   - Test database connection resilience
4. Create automated tests
   - Unit tests for repository methods
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - Stress tests for concurrent user access
5. Update API documentation
   - Add information about new health endpoints
   - Document database-specific behaviors
   - Update error handling documentation
