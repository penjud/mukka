# MongoDB Integration Fix - Password Comparison Issue

## Issue Summary

When attempting to log in using MongoDB as the storage backend, the auth server was crashing with a segmentation fault during password comparison. This was likely due to a lack of error handling in the `verifyPassword` method in the User model, causing bcrypt to crash when it encountered unexpected data formats.

## Root Cause

1. The `userSchema.methods.verifyPassword` method lacked defensive checking and error handling.
2. When the password hash wasn't in the expected format or was undefined, bcrypt would crash with a segmentation fault.
3. The login route didn't have adequate error handling around the MongoDB password verification process.

## Fix Implementation

1. **Enhanced Password Verification Method**:
   - Added defensive checks for the passwordHash to ensure it's a valid string
   - Added try/catch error handling to prevent crashes
   - Improved logging for debugging

2. **Enhanced Password Setting Method**:
   - Added input validation for the password parameter
   - Added try/catch error handling
   - Improved error reporting

3. **Improved Login Route**:
   - Enhanced error handling in the login route
   - Added fallback to file-based storage when MongoDB authentication fails
   - Added additional logging for debugging purposes

4. **Testing and Verification**:
   - Created a test script to verify password verification works without crashing
   - Reset the admin password to ensure compatibility between MongoDB and file storage
   - Tested with various edge cases (null, undefined, empty string)

## Verification

1. Tested the password verification method with various input types
2. Confirmed that the method now properly handles errors instead of crashing
3. Reset the admin user password and verified successful verification

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy the Fix**:
   - Deploy the updated codebase
   - Monitor for any further authentication issues

2. **Long-term Improvements**:
   - Add unit tests for the User model methods
   - Implement health check monitoring for authentication-related errors
   - Consider a user migration tool to ensure all users have properly formatted password hashes
